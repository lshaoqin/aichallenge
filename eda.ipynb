    "# Summary\n",
    "It's my first time doing such an extensive EDA, so apologies for many things being sloppier and messier than they ought to be - I didn't expect to reuse so much code for one, so more helper functions would definitely have been helpful. A more consistent naming scheme would also have made things clearer and less confusing for myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "I must also declare from the start that a lot of the code in this notebook was generated with GitHub Copilot. However, it only helped me with the implementation of the code, and not with the steps I wanted to take. The methods explored in this notebook are from my own self-reading and thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Categorical Data\n",
    "For the categorical data, I explored the chi-squared test and the mutual information gain test to prune features. However, the features pruned caused the models to perform slightly worse (if only marginally), and this dataset is quite small, so I ended up keeping all features.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried a variety of models, starting with Linear Regression as I thought the target variable was closer to ordinal in nature. However, Linear Regression performed quite poorly. Models which predicted a categorical target variable performed much better instead, such as Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text Data\n",
    "For the text data, first cleaned up the text, then tried running it through a LGTM Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network respectively. The CNN performed slightly better, and I'm quite happy with its performance given it is predicting in isolation of other features, and despite still containing some unfamiliar words after the processing (for example, some descriptions were in Malay.)\n",
    "\n",
    "I then tried using a LLM(gpt-3.5-turbo) to generate predictions. Though not as good as the neural networks, it performed slgihtly above my expectations. I think it may have been possible to push it to perform better through fine-tuning, or use it as a way to generate new features, but I couldn't explore this due to time constraints (looming exams 😭). This is an area that I'm very interested to explore in the future though.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, I was also unable to integrate the predictions of the two models, and they both performed better individually despite my exploration of using the CNN predictions as a variable, or to find the average of the two predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The final model\n",
    "In the final model, I plan to generate two predictions - the speed of the pet being adopted based on the categorical/quantitative data, and the speed of the pet being adopted based on the text data. I believe they can be used in two ways - the first one can be used to recommend pets which are more likely to be popular for adopters, as well as identify pets which may have a problem being adopted so they too can be pushed more often for adopters to consider. The second prediction acts more like a grade for the description, where a poor prediction might mean that the description can be written in a better/more appealing manner."
