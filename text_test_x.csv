Name,Description
3 Little Kittens,"They say cats have 9 lives. But really these little kitties only have one shot at finding someone to love and be loved - only one life to live. Looking for a home for 3 beautiful little kittens, 3 months old. Was assigned to send them off to SPCA today but I realized that they would barely have a shot amongst the hundreds and possibly thousands of cats that are sent there. So this is my mission: to find a loving home for each one of them because everyone deserves a chance..."
Rory,"Rory is now ready for adoption. Please share. He is such a sweetheart, friendly & extremely manja. Please find him a home. Rory was rescued from an owner who used to beat him with a stick that had long nails in it which tore up his skin. When we rescued him he was on a leash that was too short to allow him to sit properly & there were stains of dried blood on the floor around him. He was not fed and there was no water bowl. He has now recovered very well. We look to you for his happy ending. Thank you. ps: For those interested, photos of Rory at point of rescue are available on earlier posts on our page at www/facebook.com/furkidsfarm."

Sweety Kittens,I found this cat 6 kittens in my condo currently taking care but want responsible owners for them can be adopted seperately or toghter as well
Dusty & Ashley,"These two little fellas were abandoned  the hillside near my home =(.. Dusty is a really nice cat which comes when called (when not playing with his sister) and is gentle when you play with him, he meows really softly. He is able to sleep while he is in your arms. Ashley is the adventurous type, going here and about, exploring every corners and she really enjoys climbing up and down. Both of them loves to climb trees and are very eager to their daily morning milk. They are really active and they really do make you smile when looking at them. Both of them are toilet-trained (they use the sand). Hope they will be adopted together, it'll be cruel to separate the siblings. I would rather not give them away but I have 3 other adult cats at home and these kittens are giving them a huge amount of stress. Would be pleased if someone adopt them. =)..."
Kimmie,"Hi, my name is Kimmie. I have a good life style and I'm looking for cat lover who can provide me with what I am enjoying now, not less but equivalent or more. In return, I won't give you trouble and will be your best company ever. About myself: I am about one year 5 months old female and weigh about 5 pounds. I am DSH and I have 4 colorful attractive colors on my body. My colors are very unique. I am not a lap cat and do not like to be carried around much as I'm independent. I need my space. Other than that I am a very good cat. I have been neutered. I do not shed much fur because I am very healthy due to my daily intake of vitamins. My vitamins are self fed. My daily diet is as follows: for breakfast I enjoy a can of fancy feast premium cat canned food followed by free-flow royal canin dry food as my in between snacks. I need to drink a lot of water. I am toilet trained. Please provide cat litter tray with a reasonable amount of sand. Please keep me in door and do not leave your doors or windows open. I am a health freak; daily vitamins of 2 capsules of yeast is a must for me as I am crazy about my vitamins to keep my body and color attractive. Not to worry as you need not mince my vitamins. Just put 2 capsules in my cat bowl and I will take care of it! I am very independent. If you can meet my requests above, please take me home and promise me that you will give me everlasting love. Please do not apply if you are planning to feed Kimmie with left overs food, friskies or whiskas or equivalent, rice etc. Candidates are encouraged to apply provided you are prepared to feed Kimmie with royal canine (sensible) and fancy feast premium canned food. Please SMS Abby at for adoption."

"Big Moo Aka Lembu, Moonster, Gizmo","Hi everyone! My foster mummy's friend found me in a storm drain with my brother and sister when we were less than 2 weeks old. It was raining and we cried for our cat mother but she didn't come. So, mummy's friend climbed into the drain and rescued us. Unfortunately she didn't know how to care for such young kittens so she passed us onto our foster mummy.. We were weak and sickly but mummy tried to keep us alive with bottles of kitten formula and visits to the vet. Sadly, my brother and sister died after two weeks when they caught terrible viruses. I'm the only survivor. Now, I'm strong and old enough to be adopted by someone kind, loving, and responsible. I'm hand-reared so that means i will be a great companion. I'm not afraid of people because they are all i know. Sometimes i think i'm human too. Because i'm hand-reared, i lack some of the skills that other cats have. For example, i do not know how to groom myself properly, the person who adopts me must bathe me and brush my hair every week. I also lack survival skills and i'm not familiar with any of the dangers otuside so i must be an INDOOR cat. My foster mummy could not teach me any normal cat behaviors but I am totally litter-box trained. It would be great if the adopter has another cat, a very patient one, that i can learn from and play with. Here are some details about me: Current diet: Royal Canin Babycat 34 Dewormed: Once, two weeks ago, to be repeated again soon. Litterbox trained: I use the litterbox all the time. Vaccinations and Neutering are COMPULSORY for adoption. Adopter must pay for the vaccinations and neutering. I am an INDOOR cat. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT. Adopter must update my foster mummy on my progress and allow a home visit."

Sandra,"On the 2/1/, while i was parking my car for work i stumble a female mongrel dog together with 6 puppies lying on a deserted house opposite subang airport. The house has been demolished half way and all the brick and wire was left there. The female dog was very thin and her bone was visible, the puppies (aprox 2 -3 months old) looks healthy to me. I decided to feed them kibble daily. The mother dog was very cautious with me she will wait until i put the kibble on the ground and move away only then she will eat the kibble and she never came close to me. The next day when i was on my way to feed the dogs i saw 1 more puppies is playing together with the rest of the 6 puppies that makes a total of 7 puppies. And the puppy was injured on her left leg, most probably she hurt herself while playing under the bricks and wire. Today 6/1/ was very lucky for me, i was able to catch the injured puppy and bring it over to the vet. Dr Sam told me that the puppy may have fallen or accidently cut on a sharp object while playing. It was lucky the wound been treated earlier if the wound is left untreated maggot will appear. Dr Sam have dewormed and clean up the wound and bandage it and told me to bring the puppy over to the clinic on this coming friday 8/1/ for some minor operation. The minor operation is to remove some excessive flesh and to stich up the wound so that it will recover more faster. But the real good news is the puppy was tested negative for distemper and parvo virus. Overall the puppy was in great health. The puppy is whining and sometime a bit of howling as if to me it was calling for its mother and her sibling. Temporary i will be fostering this puppy until it recover and hopefully there is someone is willing to adopt her, As i'm staying in an apartment and i'm having my own dog with me, i'm worry my neighbour will start to complain. There are 6 more puppies plus the mother dog waiting for adoption."

He has taken these cats in out of his good heart, any donation even RM10 would be great to thank the doctor and his clinic for being an angel to foster/feed/vaccinate/take care of the cats without asking a single cent. If anyone is interested you can visit Valley Pets Vet Clinic in Sg.Long, Cheras or contact me for further info ^^)"

 PINKY ,"POSTED ON BEHALF OF OUR FRIEND MANDY. please kindly contact her directly if you wish to adopt: . TQ :) Pinky is one of the community cat that our friend-Mandy taking care of. Pinky lives at the back alley of her house and she feeds the group of cats daily. Pinky is a very very adorable, sweet, friendly, manja and tame cat. She loves dog and is very attached with one of the community dog - Bobby. Bobby is a sweet and friendly dog too and she gets along well with Pinky and the cats. Unfortunately past two weeks Pinky dissapeared for two days and she was found with severe injuries on her back side and it bleeds badly. It was diagnosed as dog bite wound and we believe that Pinky might got bite by other stray dogs around that area..she might think that dogs are all as friendly as Bobby and would play with her. Poor Pinky is still hospitalized in vet clinic. The vet are forced to cut off her long beautiful tail as the tissues and skin of the tail were damaged. We're worried that after she got back to the back alley she might got bite again as she's too friendly with dog. Pinky definitely deserves a very good and loving home. Please, adopt her if you're able to. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - Always keep cat indoor all the time - Agree to bring her for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat him like your own precious family members Please give a home to Pinky ‚ô•"

Affectionate One Waiting For Owner!,"more about him: 1) loves children 2) very gentle 3) loves the company of another dog (adopting his brother too would be great!!!) 4) curious about cats (but don't attack) 5) loves running 6) enjoys human attention * * * * * This adorable, obedient, affectionate dog was found in Ara Damansara along with two other ""strays"" - one black, another his colour with patches too. He has on a frayed yellowish collar, so he could've been lost for a while, as he's also very skinny, and he's already neutered when found. Estimated age to be about 1 year old, as he still pees like a gal and has young teeth and good skin. Found in Ara Damansara, though he could've come from anywhere if he's been lost for sometime. He knows how to sit, shake hand and come. He can walk off-leash following people (those who show kindness to him). He sits well in the car. VERY PEOPLE FRIENDLY (so must've been treated very well by humans during his early months). He was hanging around near an unoccupied house in the residential area with the two other dogs despite occasionally being beaten by one particular resident who dislike ""strays."" They also take shelter at a nearby field in the residential area. They've been roaming the area probably since December . If nobody claims him in a week, we'd like to have him adopted! This is a dog that will reward it's keepers with affection and guarding of family property! He is kept at a neighbour's house for a few days, and he will bark at unknown passers-by and unknown cars parked near the house. Would be great if adopters take in another of his buddies from the streets too. He loves attention and freedom. When chained, will whine CONTINUOUSLY for attention if he knows that dog-lovers are within hearing distance. When left to roam free within the compound of the home, he's a real darling! He's quiet, he naps, he's playful when people are around, he's alert when he sees strangers - the perfect dog for a family who'd spend time playing and running/walking him! He makes a wonderful companion dog as well as an alert dog (eg. alert family of possible intruders). Would be great if new owners can take in 2 or more pets. We've taken in this lovely dog and his 2 companions, and he seems to love having other dogs around! Note: SAFE AROUND CATS! He's curious in chasing and approaching them, but non-agressive and stays 2 feet away from usually hissing cats that he approaches! update on: 1st Feb Open for adoption!!! This darling doggie is now kept with another stray who appears to be the ""brother"". The brother was found intact, and when they first started roaming Ara Damansara, was average in weight. however, after roaming for over a month (as sighted by rescuer), he got skinnier and skinnier. The brother is very good on leash, hardly barks, just wags tail when see loving humans and doesn't jump. would be great if a family can adopt BOTH DOGS, as they tend to be happier and quieter and get to play together."

Bailey,"Bailey is still patiently waiting for someone to fall in love with her & provide her with a loving home and family. No luck so far. Bailey has been awaiting a furever home for 21 months. We couldn't keep Bailey as our female dog isn't very nice so we couldn't trust her with Bailey, so she's currently being taken care of by the amazing people at KL Pooch Rescue. She enjoys being outdoors the most but also loves lying in front of a fan inside or snuggling with her humans. Once she gets attached to you, she's a very loyal & protective (but not aggressive) companion. Bailey can jump very tall fences so a secured yard is a must. A large property would be ideal as she loves to wander freely and check things out. Could you be the wonderful family she's been praying for? She would be ever so happy to have a family of her own & truly deserves one. She is a very sweet dog. If you're looking for an amazing friend and extremely loyal companion, Bailey is your girl!"
O-peng,"I found this dog back in May . She was abandoned by the roadside under the scorching hot sun (was around 2pm when i stumble upon her). She was given rice and a shirt inside a box only. Her skin condition was very bad and she can barely moved back then. She was so emaciated i can see all her ribs! I took her to the vet and paid for all her medication. I couldn't bring her back home as I have 2 dogs already. My mom wouldn't allow me to bring her back. So she stayed at the vet for almost 2 months until i found a shelter who is willing to take her in under the condition that i pay them every month. I agreed as I do not wish for her to be caged her whole life. After almost 6 months at the shelter, I got a call to pick her up because the shelter received an eviction letter. She will be moving to a smaller place and will not be able to house so many dogs. So she's giving back all the dogs that was left there. I am keeping her temporary but not for long. I thought of putting her back to the street, but her size is a bit small and she has not been on the street for so long. I'm afraid she will not survive. She is a pretty good guard dog despite her size. Very loving as well. She's very agile and fast too not to mention greedy. She will jump up the table and eat all the food. She survived after eating 12 chocolates! One hell of a tough dog I must say. I'm running out of time, really desperate for an adopter. I really do not wish to put her back on the street. Please help if you can."

Ragdoll,"::How I found the cat:: I've seen this cat for few days and it actually belongs to my neighbour. Recently, it seems like they always forgot to let her entered their home. On 16 Sept, I found her again outside of her owners home with a bag of frieskies on the floor. It seems like the owner has move out from the place (I saw all the unwanted stuff in front of the place). The cat seems to be domesticated and can't live on its own. I took her into my place but I can't afford to adopt the cat for a long time. I'm still a student and always at the library doing research or go to class. Plus, i also will have financial issue if I adopt her (Even now I only eat a meal per day) I didn't named her yet since I don't want to get too attach. She is a friendly and well mannered cat. She likes to be among people, responds when people talk to her and know how to use the litter box. There are a few drawbacks: She is pregnant(I'm not sure how many months), she have fleas, she have earmites, I'm not sure if she is vaccinated or not, and maybe she have worms. I hope a kind and sincere person will adopt her. She is a lovable cat and I hope the next owner will treat her right."
A Kitten For Good Home.,"She is a stray kitten... As she is very tame to human, and looked very pity, I brought her in and hoping someone could provide a good home for her.. There are many stray dogs as well, so i scared that the little kitten will be chased..and get hurt..Besides, if this female kitten is left on the street, when she grow up will produce more kittens..so, hopefully the adopter can neuter her. I am not sure how old she is, it looks like two months..but, it seems tht her body is quite tiny for her age,(although looked large in the pic) maybe doesn't get enough food.. now, she eat very well and (very much, ha3)and is playful... she is quite obedient too.. she is guaranteed toilet trained.. she is not scared of human at all... Overall, she is a nice cat.. Pls contact: . thx.."

JUNO & MIKO,"This is an unseparable Yin Yang twin.The darker one is defensive the brighter one is submissive. But both of them are very playful n affectionate to human. They are only for giving and receiving love, not breeding (neutered). New owner must -not separate them -keep them cageless -vaccinate yearly n give proper health care -have no other cat in house or it will take time to adapt cause the big one is defensive -allow me to see their picture updates, as requested by previous owner they came all the way from Johor from an owner who cant keep them due to arrival of a baby and are transited somewhere else for a week before i can get em. Now they are at my house (Bangsar) but my cats wont accept them. so they are a bit underweight now from all those transitional stress.but u can see in 1st pic how they look when they were still fit, such a big breed :) :).. im giving em to a suitable home for the best of them along with- litterbox, food for about 2months (right now),littersand n other small things."

Blueys,"The Blueys were recued by my neighbor in the drain. Took them up & didn't know what to do with them. Mother cat didn't come back to feed. So passed over to me. I foster them for a night with Pet's own milk. Then handed over to Kah Yein (founder of animalcare.org)to foster for more than a month now. She became the fosterer & did a fantastic job as the Blueys are almost equal in size not as before, one healthier & bigger & the other is weaker & smaller. They have been dewormed, examined by the vet, vaccinated & given a clean bill of health. The Blueys are up for adoption. They need to be adopted together. They need each other for company and as playmates. They need each other's warmth as well. Fosterer criterion for adoption: Love them as much as you love yourself. She only has one pledge ""Please be committed to loving and caring for them for their entire lifetime"". Home must be landed. Must have good history with cats. Blueys must be kept indoor at all times. Should be fed premium food ( no Whiskas, Friskies kibbles if possible) Must have a steady vet clinic for health follow up & emergencies."

Your New Baby,"A handsome homeless kitty found at ground floor of my aparentment, roaming for days searching for home. (Suspecting an abondoned home cat) He walked into my house few days ago, searching for his home, I then observed him and found out he was visiting floors to find his home but he failed. He ends up staying at the ground floor, seeking attention from people who walk by, but most people ignore him. He is not overly active, very polite and love to stay close with people and he even sleeps on me. Due to family condition I am not able to take in this cat, I really appreciate if you are able to share and help to find a new home for him by sharing out this post with friends and family."

Eva,Eva is a pure maine coon. She takes time to warm up to you. Was a breeding queen. She is spayed and vaccinated. One of her eyes had bad infection which the breeder left untreated. Treatment done but the eye is slightly smaller than the other. She is a large female cat and gets along with all cats and kittens. Fine with dogs too. Need lots of brushing and grooming cos her fur is really thick and long. Only adopt her if you are patient and have plenty of time to groom her.

I'm very upset by the whole situation but I already have three cats and am also feeding two other strays in the area so there is no way I can adopt him :( This particular cat has never been a stray and he's still living in the backyard of the empty house. I thought my cats were super manja until I met this little fellow. He's so cute and when I went up to him for the first time he snuggled and crawled into my lap! He's very tame as he was always a house pet. Those blue eyes are gorgeous! He's about a year old as we've seen him grow from a very little kitten, playful and smart. We insist on getting caring owners who will love and care for him for the rest of his life :) Contact me at or for faster response. Thanks!"

Onion,"Onion is described as a Rottweiler and A Belgian Shepard because his body structure is mainly on a Belgian Shepard but parts of his body aren't. Examples are his paws which are muscular and looks like a Rottweiler's paw. Onion is a good dog, he is like every other pet a family would need. Although there is the fact that he isn't really good with toddlers because he is considered medium in size and might accidentally push one over with his snout by sticking his nose in. He is nosy. He protects you from wild life harm like snakes, though remember after he does kill one, please throw it away asap as it could cause a bad stench or he might eat it, it never happened before but it could. Safety first. In conclusion, Onion is a great house pet, he needs space to venture and wonder as he is an agile dog, that requires exercise by running. He is "" okay "" for a family but not recommended for one that has toddlers unless fences are raised. He is also friendly to other people most of the time, but he still protects you from other wild beasts. We hope that Onion gets a good family so that he can protect and live a good life! Relocated to PAWS Society because of time constrain, please adopt him, I want him to have a good life. Pilmoor Estate, Subang Airport Road, Subang, Selangor, Malaysia. - See more at:"

The reason I put him up for adoption: I have told my family that I will only temporary rescued him and will put up for adoption, being that we are living in a condominium, it took me some effort to convince the management to let me keep him for a while. For now, it's been 10 months, since he is in good shape now, it's time for me to let go."

Lovely Year-old + 5 Month Dogs,"Found these two sweet dogs chained to a flimsy wooden shelter. Their owner does not love them nor appropriately care for them. The are always chained and get tangled up to a point where they cannot move. They are very friendly and sweet dogs and bonding with other people and dogs should come easily, as it did with me. Very energetic, intelligent (more so than my purebreed) and friendly with children and people. They will be easy to train but are very social and need to be around people or dogs alot. I hardly bark and only do so when they see something exciting. There are many rats, strays, reckless drivers around and I greatly fear for their health and safety if they are not adopted soon."

We can arrange a meet-up somewhere public so you can meet her in advance before deciding. Much love, Shakira and Oli ------------------------------------------------------- Hey guys, I have 3 adorable mixed breed female puppies, Shadoh the little black one, Oli and Peanut are white with black patches. They were found motherless and hungry on the streets by a friend. I've had them since 14th Feb (a week now) and will care for them till I find them good homes. They have been de-wormed and vaccinated and I have the vaccination cards as proof. They are not spayed as I don't think it is necessary. I have a 5 year old Golden Retriever that isn't spayed and is perfect, I may spay her in the near future to prevent ovarian cancer. I am leaving the choice up to the adopt-ers. Peanut is a sweetheart, timid, quiet and loves food; Oli is full of energy, curious, loving and very friendly, she was the first to approach my big Retriever; Shadoh is slightly smaller in size, fun and adventurous and also very loving and friendly. Shadoh and Oli always play together and are inseparable so I'm hoping these two could be adopted by one home. But 3 separate homes are more than welcome too. They are all so loving and cheeky. I am HOPING to have them house trained by the time one of you chooses to adopt them. I'm looking for caring dog lovers with families to care for these lil' cuties. I would love to keep them for myself but am leaving the country by the end of March. So PLEASE contact me(calls preferred) if you are interested. We can set up a meeting for you to meet them in person before deciding. Much love, Shakira, Oli, Shadoh and Peanut Bangsar, KL."

Two male neutered cats (coz i want to do my part in reducing strays in this world) currently at around 2.5 yrs old. Very lovable & playful. Raised as indoor cats (litter trained) but loves the occasional outdoors after a few minutes of sniffing around to get familiar with the surroundings.

The long-tailed black cat is named Munch Munch & shortened to Munchee & interchangeably called Wer-Wer (pronounced something similar to 'wear') coz he tends to meow that way :) Munchee loves the outdoors & chasing lizards & giving head-butts & loves taking a nap on my legs. Both also loves playing chase with a feather-stick, going round & round & round. I'm looking for cat-lovers who can give them a loving home. Their basic cat stuff & toys will be passed along as well. I just need someone who really loves cats and will take good care of them. Please let me know if you or someone you know would want to adopt them. My email: TQ"

Kaiser,"I am looking for a loving permanent home for Kaiser. Kaiser is a really amazing, sweet and funny dog. He is very loving and affectionate, who loves and NEEDS attention. He needs someone that will treat him like part of the family and the sweet dog he is. He grew up with 2 cats and another small dog. he loves cats however it takes him awhile to respond well to new dogs. He never really socialized with children before, so if you have kids I would suggest meeting Kaiser with them before making a decision.He grew up mostly as an indoor dog but can do well outside if there is a shady place for him to relax during the hot parts of the day. NO Cage, No chain! please note that Kaiser is a family pet not guard dog. Kaiser is a pure breed rottweiler, he has his MKA certificate, basic dog obedience training certificate and a good citizens award metal. He also knows almost all the tricks: sit, stay, shake etc.and is a super fast learner. The reason I have to give him up for adaption is, Im an expat who was living in Malaysia for 5 years, I had to leave and unfortunately I was unable to take Kaiser with me (his breed was band in the country I moved to). I'm looking for someone to give him a permanent loving home. Kaiser is one of those dogs that crave that best friend relationship with his owner. so if you think he sounds like a good match for you please email me. my number is not available as I am out of the country, Kaiser is staying with my friend in Selangor for now."

"Miu Ciu, Small Black, Orengy & Teleng","Miu Ciu, Small Black, Teleng & Orengy are about 4 months old today. They were born on 9th Dec . They will be up for adoption. My heart breaks to release them all. Since they were two months old, I slept with them every day until now. They are very close to me. Even I cried during writing this information. :'( But I cannot keep them all because I already have 11 cats for now. Due to limited space, this 4 baby is open for adoption. These cute baby should be an INDOOR cat only (I never let any of my cat out before, so they have not been expose to outdoor). Very sad to let them go actually~ Currently they are on Royal Canin for kitten. Let me tell you a little story about them. Miu Ciu, the youngest. Very naughty but spoiled. Have a short tail. The color is rather unique, where there are white, orange and cream colors. Oh yes, he likes to ""meow"" a lot. Small Black, the third born kitten. Look elegant and magnificent, probably because of its color. He is black and his hair is rather soft. His chest are white and also white-legged like wearing a socks. His eyes are always round as in ready for ""attacking"" mode. Orengy, second born kitten. A little careless and playful. His eyes were squinting. Long tail, orange tabby and white. The face looks confused, but also love to play. Lastly, Teleng. The first born kitten, getting severe flu when he was two months old, caused him a fever reaching 42 degrees celsius and even seizures. Now he's fully healed, but his head slightly tilted due to the fever. That's why he looks pretty cute with his shortcomings. Just like his brother, Teleng is black and white-legged. Anyone interested can contact me for pre-booking. This will also provide you some time to do the preparation before this two cute kitten come to your lovely home. I only prefer cat lover, if possible want them to be adopted as pair. Because I love to see them both together and they are very attached to each other."

Husky,"Husky was rescued in a Construction area. He was brought to the vet and it was found that there is an ulcer in his right eye and a small wound onhis tail. He is now under treatment but will be cured soon. It will be great if someone can give him the deserving care he needs. He is very loving and enjoys being cuddled. At night he sleeps soundly without any disturbance. Keeping him is not ahassle at all. Just that for now, his medication (eye drops) for his eye needs to be given regularly. Food wise, he has milk now but we are slowly trying to feed him puppy food as recommended by the vet. All medication will be provided to the adopter without any charge. We just want to ensure that he gets a loving home."

Rosco,"2-year old male mixed breed Rosco up for adoption! Neutered, dewormed, vaccinated. Gorgeous mix of colours. He was rescued off the streets as a puppy with his brother and was sent to a shelter. His brother was adopted and since then Rosco grew up alone in a noisy hectic place. He is the sweetest and friendliest dog ever and the only reason why he hasn't been adopted by any dog lover is that he doesn't get along with other dogs. With humans, he is an absolute angel. Friendly, playful, smart, obedient. But somehow, volunteers have been working really hard to get him over his only vice (hostile to other dogs) and haven't been successful. Hence, he urgently needs a loving home whereby he will be only dog and will be showered w TLC and cuddles. He would be a great companion and pet for anyone as long as he is the only dog in the house. He is a real sweetheart and even has a heart on his forehead! Please PM me if you want to adopt this darling and help share and spread the word to anyone you know who's had dogs, but doesn't have one at the moment and wants one and only one now :)"

Kenzo,"I've adopted him when he was 4 months old from a stranger. Raised him at my rent apartment during my study year. Now I'm done with my studies and currently staying at my parents home. However my little brother is allergic to cat fur. My parents didn't allowed me to keep Kenzo due to my little brother condition. Hence I'm looking for a good & kind-hearted soul that willing to adopt my baby. He deserve a better home. Upon adoption, I will give the adopter the litterbox, water & food bowl, remaining cat litter & kibbles, as well as carrier. Kenzo, 1 years ++ male, dewormed, indoor cat, vaccinated at gov vet (will provide the vaccination certificate upon adoption), not yet castrated. He dislikes to be trapped in cage/carrier or else he will meow, whine or growl incessantly. He also terrified of riding in the car, he seems to be fear & not enjoy the experience. Kenzo is loving, funny and super friendly boy. He is a clingy & spoilt cat with adorable attitude. Active and playful but will collapse after 5-10mins of playing, maybe because he is kinda fat. He has a weird habit of grinding his teeth which is cuteeeee that might fix your mood swing. Litter trained. His light blue eyes are very captivating and could melt your heart instantly. Adopters must agree to keep him indoors or in a secure yard & not to put him in cage unless it's for quarantine/ transportation. Adoption fee RM50 is to make sure new owner is serious to take care of him. Looking for cat lover that can give he a forever home where he deserves more love, care and attention. Location : Horizon Hills, Johor Bahru. Please don't hesitate to message me regarding Kenzo adoption. Thank you. Whatsapp/SMS only, strictly NO CALLS"

He's eating and pooping well, and likes a lot of attention. He's got some sort of an eye infection, which I will happily pay the treatment of. He needs a loving home - ideally a multi-cat home!

Renny,"2 Weeks have passed since I posted Renny and unfortunately nobody came forward to meet Renny. I urgently appeal again to somebody out there to consider her as your new friend. Almost every day Renny gets soaking wet due to rain and non availability of a shelter. Sometimes she don't even want food, just a pet on her head and a friendly word. By wagging her tail she tells me that that is more important then anything else. Please give her a chance, there must be somebody out there who can help her. This is Renny. Renny supposed to be a German Shepard or a German Shepard mix because nobody really knows. Renny was left by her owners when they moved out of their house. At that time, the security guards of the Housing scheme kept an eye on her but she was basically neglected. Renny had difficulties to walk and was very skinny. We started to give her proper food and medication and little by little Renny began to show here true potential. Renny is very friendly with people, very smart and on top of that, in the true spirit of German Shepards, a great guard dog. If you need a dog to guard your compound, if you can provide Renny with a dry place to sleep and some good food, you got yourself a fantastic employee!! 2"

Two Lovable Female Doggies,"This is a story about Clever, Hong Hong and Bobby. They grew up along Anggerik Aranda . They weren't abandoned by their parents. It's just that being canine, unlicensed ones, their parents were captured by MBSA two years ago. Since then, residents of have been taking care of them by feeding and sheltering them whenever possible. As they are females, they have all been neutered (at 9 months old) to ensure unsolicited attention from other male canines. Bobby (a female but named such), in human being's term, is like an autistic child. She was traumatised by her parents' abduction at an early age and is extremely afraid of human. She is very attached to Nike (the male Alsation, living in the first house, two doors away). It's extremely difficult to capture her, even MBSA has failed many times. Clever, as she was taken away from her mum at birth(someone adopted her and didn't want her after a few months) and was whining and pining for her for the initial few weeks..... she is pretty hyper, short fused and likes to chase cars.... and strangers.... so I am terribly if anyone here has been chased or barked by her. However, her bark is worse than her bite, just give her a shout and fierce look,she will run off....... She is a very good watch dog though..... and very obediently comes back to the house after she has done her share of running for the night. She doesn't eat much but more frequent than usual (three small portion), not choosy about her food and she's fine with water. She isn't the lovey dovey type though. As for Hong Hong, she is definitely the prima donna type. Loves to be cuddled, will know how to win back your heart after being naughty. She will look at you with her almond shaped eyes and lift her paws and rest them on you...... She's awfully afraid of thunder and will hide behind you or try to get into the house whenever it rains cats and dogs. She hates water and chooses food) For months now, i have kept Clever and Hong Hong in my house. Sometimes they do escaped but they will still head home for food. Bobby, she's outside, she has been taking care of herself. I just feed her dinner every evening. Actually, the three of them are part of a litter of 8. We have managed to get the rest adopted..... It is with a heavy heart that i have to put Clever and Hong Hong up for adoption. One of the main reasons is, my son and I are acute bronchitis sufferers and having dogs in our compound aren't helping with our condition. Secondly, i am having some muslim students coming to my house for classes next year and it is not convenient for the dogs to be around....... Hong Hong can be a really good companion dog and Clever, a good watch dog..... If you know of anyone who is looking for such dogs, please let me know.... my contact no is. Only serious inquiries will be entertained. Thank you very much for your kind attention. BTW, April, one of their siblings, is staying at one of the neighbour's house along too..... so actually is a doggy's lane..... most of us love dogs, and because of them, we are a closely knitted neighbourhood..... we know each other well and watch out for one another..... Hope adopting Hong Hong or Clever will bring such atmosphere to your neighbourhood too.... Cheers..... I am up by one now coz a neighbour who initially taken one of the female pups have decided not to keep the pups......"

Toby,"Rescued from the car park area, Puchong"
"Snowy, Luna, Rajah","Three gorgeous medium length hair cats rescued from a roadside in setapak. Snowy is the mama cat. She has greyish black fur with a white undercoat. I don't know how else to describe it. She looks dark grey but if you brush her fur up its all white underneath.. She's no more than 2 years old, still a young lady. She's an affectionate and intelligent cat that prefers a quiet, mellow environment. I think her type of coat coloring is called Black Smoke. The little black tabby with striped legs is Luna. She's a female kitten, about 3 weeks old now and looks just like her mummy. She's the lazier of the two kittens. She loves sleeping and cuddling up with Snowy all day. The silver tabby is Rajah. I've named him after Princess Jasmine's pet tiger in Disney's Aladdin cartoon. He's more adventurous than his cozy, comfort-loving sister. Every time I check on them, he's awake and looking at me with wide eyes. The kittens will be ready for adoption in about 4-6 weeks time, once they are fully weaned and litter-trained. Snowy will be ready for adoption once her kittens are fully weaned and she has been spayed. - Set up a meeting with me and the pet of your choice. - We'll have a chat and see if you and kitty are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. Although I do volunteer with the Selangor SPCA in my free time, I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Interested parties can text or email me. A brief introduction of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated."

MORE pictures available here: THE HISTORY: They were basically abandoned by their previous owner who left them behind when he moved out. The couple that moved in was left to look after them and has slowly been finding homes for the cats over the last year. There were 28 to begin with and there are 18 left. The last 18 NEED HOMES URGENTLY as the couple is no longer able to care for them. Due to some personal issues, and a new baby then need to move out. None of the local pet associations are willing to take them on so it is once again left up to concerned caring citizens to help out and lend a hand. THIS is an URGENT call for HELP! These cats need homes within the NEXT TWO WEEKS. Please invite ALL your friends to this event which shall be on going until all the cats are rehomed. Invite them ALL because even if they themselves do not want a cat, they may know someone who knows someone who does. THANKS FOR CARING! soraya"

They've been with me until , after which I had to give them to an aunt temporarily as I was overseas for a year. I urgently need to find them a new loving home as I have a baby now and cannot have them in the house as their fur makes my baby sneeze. I've recently brought them to the vet for grooming & latest check-up. They are healthy and just need some minor attention to get them back on track. They've been dewormed at the last check-up & they were neutered back when they were a year old or so. There is no adoption fee, I just need to find a cat lover who is willing to give them a loving home and care for them. Please contact me if you are interested. Thank you."

Tyson,"Tyson was the last kitten rescued and adopted from a litter of 4 kittens. This is his story. Tyson, borne on 25th July (Monday) with 3 other siblings (all adopted). He endured some hardships during his 1st month as neighbors did not welcome him and the rest of the litter well (as the mother like to move them around between neighbour's garden). On 25th August , I managed to rescued 3 kittens and send to adopter but ""Tyson"" was so well hidden I did not managed to get him until 28th August . I remember it was a rainy night and I found him crying for his mother by the side of a drain. Luckily I managed to capture him without any issue and send him to his new owner ""Sammie""; a foreigner studying here. At that point of time, Sammie said he will be here for another couple of few years and when he decides to go back, he will find a new home for Tyson. But I did not expect to hear from Sammie so soon about him leaving Malaysia permanently by . I made a mistake by letting a foreigner adopt Tyson but I know that Sammie treats Tyson well. So now that you know Tyson a little more, would you be willing to adopt little Tyson? See his pictures below, sent by Sammie to me during the few months they stayed together. **Sammie will pay for spaying expenses before surrendering Tyson."

Theodore,"Hi everyone! My name is Theo and i'm about 3 weeks old now. My auntie Rebecca rescued me on monday 15 June . She found me behind her house surrounded by dogs!! She quickly picked me up and brought me inside her house. Sadly auntie Rebecca is busy fostering 5 pups and their mum so she called my new foster mummy Lynette for help. When i arrived at mummy Lyn's house she was amazed by how chubby and healthy i looked!! She says i'm so cute that i make her eyes hurt!! I'm not weaned yet so mummy Lyn still has to feed me kitty milk. I really hate the milk bottle so i have to be syringe fed for now. I hope my teeth grow soon so I can start eating yummy canned kitten food and kibble! Mummy Lyn wants to keep me forever but she can't coz she has soooo many pets now. I hope someone will adopt me and love me like she does. I should be able to go to my new home in about 3 weeks, once i am completely weaned and litter trained. Mummy lyn wants me to be healthy, so my new parents will have to pay for my vaccinations and they must neuter me because there are already too many homeless hungry kittens like me struggling in the streets and suffering..

Roxanne,"Meet Roxanne ‚Äì The Cutie Pie. 4 months olds, Female & Vaccinated A day after Deepavali this year, we heard a puppy yelping at 2 o‚Äôclock in the morning. It was so persistent and traumatizing even for us to hear. We zoned in on where this sound was coming from. It was directly at the back of our home, over a high wall near a neighbouring clubhouse‚Äôs tennis courts. We got into the car, ready with food, carrier, gloves and a cloth. Once we got into the grounds, with the help of the security guard on duty, we found in a drain that led to nowhere this teeny tiny puppy, crying pitifully with its last breaths. We caught a hold of her (no resistance was given) and brought her home. After a reviving drink of warm goat‚Äôs milk, little Roxanne was all wagging tail, snuggling her way into our laps and licking our hands in gratitude and instant love. She was de-fleadand was given a warm bed, and all she did for two days was eat, wag her tail, snuggle up and sleep. We were unsure if she would make it. But she did."

Tiger,"TIGER BEEN ADOPTED BY A KIND FARMER FROM PERAK ^^ Found him wandering around my neighborhood 3 weeks ago when I took my dog out. Suspected to be an abandoned pet since he knew the command SIT, and to do his business outside the house. He is very quiet and quite submissive. But I am working out with the submissive part, hoping that he will gain his self- confidence. He can be quite manja at times =) Tiger is with me in Bandar Kinrara 4, Puchong (Near Giant Kinrara), please do contact me at ( sms/ call) if you're able to give him a permanent home. Terms & Condition: 1) Spay/ Neuter him. 2) Vaccinate & get a license for him. 3) Provide love, care, attention, and educate them. 4) DO NOT let him run out of your house compound without putting on leash. 5) FREE adoption, but that doesn't mean you can eat/ torture/ dump it anytime you want.

"Cardi, T'Challa & Paperboy","These three adorable siblings will make perfect pets for your home! Paperboy is the most social one of the lot, and he's a playful little rascal too! Cardi is a typical princess - a little standoffish at first, but a sweetheart once you get to know her and she loves roughhousing with her brothers! And then there's little T'Challa - for a cat that's named after a superhero he is a little timid and shy, but give him some time and attention and he'll be loyal to the end. Plus, look at that cute little face! While we are ideally looking for someone who will adopt them as a trio, we will also consider anyone who wants to adopt them in pairs or individually. But fair warning, the kittens are very skittish and timid - we only found them when they were 1 1/2 months old and they aren't quite used to humans yet. They require alot of time and patience to let them warm up to you so if you don't have that then they might not be suitable for you. But trust us, with time and patience and alot of love, you will see how incredibly sweet and lovable they all are. Also, a household with small children is not advisable as skittish/nervous kittens don't work well with little tykes. What's really important to us is that they'll find a warm and loving home and that they'll be treated with the kindness and care that they deserve. Here's hoping they'll find a forever home with you!"

Ron Weasley & Harry Potter,"Whatsapp or SMS only! (Calls will not be entertained as we do have jobs) if you are interested to ADOPT THE TWO PUPPIES TOGETHER. Do not message purely to ask if they are still available because if they have been adopted, we will update the status to Adopted. Do not contact us to adopt on behalf of someone else. You will not be entertained. Please read the following T&Cs for adoption before you contact us: Terms and Conditions: 1. Tell us why you would be the perfect adopter, and your experience with dogs, if you have any dogs currently, if you live in a landed property, and if everyone in the family is in agreement to adopt the puppies. 2. Must be treated as a member of the family and not as guard dogs. 3. Preferably kept indoors, but outdoors is fine as long as there is sufficient shelter from the heat and rain. 4. Must not cage or chain the dogs unecessarily for extended periods. 5. Must be fed good food and given water daily! (yes some people don't think this is important) 6. MUST be neutered at 6 months of age. A refundable deposit of RM per puppy will be collected for this. 7. MUST be given medical care by a vet if required. 8. There will be a home inspection before the puppies are released to you. 9.

MUST not dump the dogs when it is no longer convenient to care for them. Remember a dog is for life. If you are unable to commit to care for the dogs for their entire lifetime, please do NOT adopt. ******************** These two gorgeous pups were dumped behind my vet's clinic. They are super playful, loves cuddles and loves to eat too! The two of them are very attached to each other, and are best buddies, so that's why I named them Ron Weasley & Harry Potter because they're inseparable! We hope that you can find it in your hearts to give these two rascals a good and loving home!"

Kuro,"Kuro is a sweet and round tuxedo cat with a very sweet demeanor with humans. He loves to cuddle and sit on laps for hours while demanding pets and dispensing purrs generously. Though the same cannot be said when he's with another cat. Even with his brother of the same litter he gets very aggressive and refuses to play. Also at times grows jealous when the other cat gets the attention and it manifests into aggressive sneak attacks. Kuro is a very sweet cat that deserves a home where he can be the one and only cat receiving attention from his owners. He's very sweet, very docile and extremely affectionate. We just hope for Kuro to get a loving home that he can rest assured that he'll be the one and only cat of the house."

√•¬∞¬è√ß¬ô¬Ω(Little White),"This blue-eyed kitty was found around my housing area, currently staying in my house. When we first saw her, she was super lean and emaciated. She was found to have at least 3 types of flea all around her body including her ears (now free from flea) and this is one of the reason why we are charging RM (Could be negotiable).

No Name,Found at Stadium Sulaiman Klang.
Spike,"He was a strayed dog around my housing area. He was hit by a car and he broke his leg during the accident. We took him to the vet and the vet told us that his leg wouldn't function anymore. But until today, we never gave up giving him support. Guess what, now he's running although his broken leg isn't functional anymore. He plays fetch! He runs so fast and he is friendly with people. He's a lover. He's a nice and polite dog. He's not a naughty dog at all! He is an amazing dog. But since I'm a Muslim and I have limitations of taking care of him, and to us, we think he deserves a better home and family to take care of him for the sake of his happiness. So I hope by any chance anyone out there please help him find a better family for him."

For those people who willing to adopt her, please give good shelter and foods as well as love for her. The ex-owner give me 7 days to find another adopter, otherwise they will abandon her :("
No Name,she's very manja once u know her.. wanna sell her for my mom.. she's very sweet.. ONLY FOR: 1. Have years of experience in cats. 2. Give full commitment to my Cat. (as my mom luv her very much) 3. Financial strength. (for food n vet check-ups)
Awesome,"He puts up a front and acts mean in front of strangers but in actual fact, is a lovable and well-meaning dog. It all depends on how you approach him. He generally tends to bark at anyone that passes by the house (or if there's a cat or a noisy vehicle) but it's only because he's protective of the masters of the house. He's a well-groomed and active dog that needs a lot of exercise in the morning before you leave the house. If not, he has a nasty habit of chewing anything in sight. If you do intend to adopt him, I think it would be best to channel has energies by enrolling him in agility courses or even guard/watch dog training. He likes to play fetch with a ball and I like setting him loose leash in a safe open space to play and run around with him. He knows the basic commands but is not always obedient and tends to get distracted. Though when it comes to meal times, he will always obey! He needs a firm, stable, cool-headed and knowledgable ""pack leader"" that will give him the EDA (Exercise, Discipline, Affection) that I currently can't afford to give him. If you think you fit the description, please give me call to set up a viewing appointment!"

We are looking for someone to adopt him as we have too many cats. It would be great if the person can also adopt his brother - ET. We prefer to give him up to a working Malaysian, no students. We are looking for someone who will vaccinate and neuter him and also take him for regular vet checks. He needs to be kept indoors, as He is very young. He is very good with our cats. Keeping a cat is a commitment for about 15 years and they are children that never grow up and it isn't cheap to keep a pet. Only for serious adopters."

Bambi,"Bambi was found in the middle of the road in Segambut in the evening (near KTM Segambut) and was pushed to the roadside by a kind man. At night, I went to the location to meet up with Geetha (the person who posted online in several animal rescue Facebook) to take the dog home first. We managed to get her into a cage by midnight - she was feisty and tried to bite us. She couldn't walk by then. The next morning, my bro and I took this dog to the vet and was told that the dog had broken spine that caused the hind legs to be unresponsive. We were told to put her down to avoid suffering. We didn't want to give up on her when she still tried to bite us whenever we touched her back. She still wanted to live. We took her to another vet and had scanned - she had dislocated spine, not broken, there was some nerves still as her toes did pull back when the vet pinched hard (really hard). She had lots of maggots, some were plucked by the 1st vet place, some by me (eee) and by the 2nd vet place. We used Magtox spray on her, applied med and cleaned the wound around the back of the neck. 2nd vet suspected her neck was chained or pulled with sth tight and the dislocated spine was from longer duration than the accident timing. Now her neck wound has healed with fur covering the area. Her hind legs are not moving mostly but when we pinch her toes, she would pull back her legs. Since June, she has been and is currently fostered at KL Pooch Rescue, Cheras to get swimming (once a week) and physiotherapy. I've been taking her to acupuncture sessions a few time per month to help with the pain and hopefully, she can walk soon. She is not easy to take care of. She will need love, patience and exercise for hind legs. She loves to shred papers and is ok with cats & dogs. Adopter to cover vaccination, dewormed and spaying. Facebook gallery (contains wound):"

PUPPY,"This 8-month old dog (I call her ""Puppy"") used to come to my house quite frequently and I would feed and play with her. At first I thought Puppy belonged to someone but later I came to realise that she did not have a permanent home. When it was hot or raining, she would take refuge in people's homes or at an abandon house. There were a lot of people who used to feed her as she is one of the most friendliest and loving dog I have ever met. She is friendly with both people as well as with other dogs. Yesterday, when Puppy came to my house, I realised that she was in heat. So I decided that before she gets pregnant, I better get her spayed. She has been vaccinated and in 10 days time, she will be spayed. In between those dates, I'm trying to find a loving home for her. She is temporarily being fostered by a friend but she needs to be re-homed as soon as she recovers from her operation."

No Name,"Blacky has been adopted by Rekha and family! We adopted this baby's mother in July. Little did we know that we have adopted more than one pet - but 4 more pups too! Our adopted pet started showing signs of being pregnant and gave birth to four heart-achingly cute and healthy puppies on5th August. Caring for 5 pets at home is quite a task for us, so we are hoping if you are really keen on committing into caring for a pet, do give him or his 2 other brothers a thought. We shall have him and his brothers with us for about 2 more months as they are still nursing on their mother. We shall deworm and give him 1st vaccination when he reached 2 months old. Thereafter, he will be ready to be adopted."
Dakota,"This cute puppy was rescued off of the streets. Dakota is a very active puppy who loves attention. Due to our busy schedule, we are unable to give him all the attention this sweetheart deserves. He is vaccinated and dewormed. However, he is too young to be neutered. We hope that we can find a good home that he will be happy in. We can give all supplies to whoever adopts (food, food and water bowls, leash, dog toys...etc)"
Champion And Phoenix,"Champion (White) and Phoenix (Black)are siblings rescued from a Cheras landfill where they developed maggot wounds from being bitten by other dogs. After treatment by the vet, deticked and de-wormed with first vacination out of the way, these two lovely pups are looking for a forever home. Playful and lively, easily trained (in the midst of being toilet trained). Preferably adopt together by adopter who do not have existing dogs. Finishing the vaccination doses (2 each)and spaying at 6 months are per-requisites to adopting these darlings."
Little Dragon,"Hi there, my name is Little Dragon. I‚Äôm a 4-month old boy. My mum gave birth at the underground car park of an apartment, that‚Äôs how me and my siblings were brought to the world, there are 12 of us. Not long after that, my mum was diagnosed with cervical cancer, fortunately she survived after four chemotherapy treatments. And here is my little story. Not long after I was born, I met with an accident and suffered serious concussion, I was wounded with 3 holes in my little head.. Because of that, while all my siblings started to walk I had difficulty to even stand up. In addition to that, I have blurred vision, my cranial nerves were hurt by the accident I suppose.. I have no idea when I‚Äôll recover, maybe it will stay like that forever. Luckily, after 2 months of medication, I‚Äôm able to stand and walk now, although I stumbled from time to time. My temporary caretaker has difficulty to keep for me long, I hope that I could meet with a kind master through Facebook. I know people may not like me because of my poor condition, but I‚Äôll pray and hope for a miracle. If you wished to make the miracle happen, please contact my temporary caretaker(Annie). Thank you.

Miji,"I have 2 dogs, both unwanted pups which I adopted. 3 days ago, my uncle asked me to take in another pup. Today, someone in my vicinity complained to Mpsj that I'm having 3 dogs & I got a warning that I'll be compounded within 3 days. My pets & compounds are clean, well behaved and licenced, but some ppl are just plain nasty. Miji is very manja and a small eater. She can understand commands like sit, hand, get in the cage, wait, kiss, hug and carry. She is also very alert, thus makes a good guard. I thought since she's spayed and vaccinated, she'll stand a better chance to be adopted as the new owner won't need to pay more than her annual jabs. But if someone rather take the 4 months old puppy, pls call too. I wish I can rescue all 3 of them, but I will be breaking the rules. I hope a kind hearted person who likes small dog will respond ASAP and will treat Miji well. Please help before Mpsj comes again."

Just like Mr.Pooh, I'm adventurous and very loving! I can't stop wagging my tail when i hear my name being called! Can I be your furever friend? _______________________________ Back story, we feed a bunch of strays in our area and did not manage to get one of the female dogs to be spayed in time so out pop-ed 5 little angles. We are still struggling to get our older foster dogs adopted so we thought it would be okay to leave this family where they were. But the weather was very unkind and it rained during most of the night. As a result, this furry family ended up not having a warm place to sleep at night so we decided to take them in, give them whatever we can. Unfornutely, 2 of the puppies did not make it. RIP. However, we have 3 very strong and bright puppies up for adoption, Winnie, Oreo and Minnie! They were born on June 29th (which makes them a month old today!) The mummy, QT Pie is also up for adoption! For more info, please contact Kelly Tan (preferably whatsapp) Thank you and have a great day!"

He Was ...thank You All...,"Trying to find somebody who wants to adopt a male puppy.... As you can see, he's only as big as a small cat... Please whatsapp or sms me at... I'm located at Jasmine Park, Taman Putri Kulai, Kulaijaya, Johor Yesterday morning, i was tending to my cats... It was around 7:45 AM... It was Monday, 12 January... I was outside the house at Jasmine Park, guarded area and have fences around the houses... I heard a screaming sound... I thought it was a cat screaming... But then my sister went to look for it and she saw a dog running scared in the middle of the street... On the main road (jalan besar) in front of my house... People were busy going to work, school... They tried to avoid hitting the dog... But i'm afraid something worse would happen.... Immediately i grabbed a pair of gloves and run to the main road... i caught the dog... Fortunately all cars were slowing down.. Probably because they saw me trying to save that dog... That dog was clean... No sign of it like it was a stray dog... Then i asked around... They saw someone, an Indian guy, with motorcycle, dump the dog near the main street... I got the dog safely to my house, put it in the cage... Just so you know, i'm a Malay... Have more than 23 cats in my care... I couldn't afford to care for a dog because of few difficulties.. I think some of you would know... No need for me to explain it. So it would be helpful if somebody could adopt this dog... I think it is a boy... Judging from the male part , his character that is so manja... I live in JASMINE PARK, Taman Putri, Kulaijaya, Johor..."

A Pup That Knows Sit-stay Command,"Cookie was adopted by a loving caring mother of 2, Sue Ann. I was touched by the genuine heart that Sue Ann had, she bought collar, treats, leash for Cookie. Although she is a new dog owner but she had sought advice from friends and research on her own. I am thankful to God for such a loving person like Sue Ann. This is a puppy I rescued in Seremban 2. She is really smart, though has not attended any dog training courses, she can sit still, stay still for quite a long while. There is a video clip of her stay still up to 1 minute. My fosterer has two other dogs, one is a schnauzer and another one is a mixed breed stray dog. Cookie can learn even faster than the schnauzer. When my fosterer put her in front of main door, she only barks at any stranger that passed by where the schnauzer does not care.

The Fantastic Four,"Hi Everyone! I have 1 Domestic Long Hair & 1 Domestic Medium Hair Kittens up for adoption. No fee is required but would like to trade them with premium foods. The mother was a stray and was already pregnant when i took her in to join the rest of my fur babies. I love cats but we already have 6 of our own.. and with my busy schedule, it isn't fair for me to keep them. I believe the kittens deserve a new loving home where they can be given more care and attention. The kittens are healthy, playful and litter trained."

Misty,Found at the park. Believed a lost dog. If u are interested to adopt pls contact Rachel
Bobby The Smiling Shih Tzu,"How he was found: Bobby was abandoned and was roaming around our neighbourhood one rainy afternoon - all the kids were mad happy upon his arrival. People played with him, but, as night came and heavy rain poured in, all the doors were shut and nobody let the dog in. He was begging for shelter from house to house. Bobby's conditions (health, behaviour, friendliness & etc.): Bobby is a friendly dog who enjoys being petted and brushed. He is also very playful and he requires being taken out for a walk everyday. When we first found him, his health was at a very bad stake. He smelled bad and his fur all matted. He had sensitive stomach - he suffered from diarrhoea during the first week and couldn't digest kibbles. We fed him boiled chicken/liver and very soft rice for a fortnight and now he can eat anything (healthy for a dog). I trimmed his fur the first week and brush him on a daily basis. Now he looks as charming as the ones at a dog show. We noted several behavioural problems caused by the previous owner. In other words, Bobby's owner had abused him and kicked him out of the house. Several issues were observed, e.g. Bobby is shit scared of broom stick and he shows aggression as we wear slippers in front of him (was beaten by the previous owner with broom stick/kicked with shoes on). He doesn't trust strangers (especially adults); but with patience and obedience training and a lot of treats (what we did), now he jumps around us shaking his tail happily all the time. Why we couldn't let him stay We are a cat-lover family and we currently have 2 cats at our household (more are coming). As much as I love Bobby and try to help him, my cats show strong objections and disagreements against having a dog in our house. In the end of the day, I believe Bobby deserves a better/more experienced dog owner. Terms and conditions: There is no adoption fee and no money involved. You could take him to your home as long as you agree to/that - 1. Take him out for (at least) a walk everyday 2. Brush him on a daily basis, otherwise Bobby would have a matted fur 3. Strictly NO punishment in any form. You can correct him if he does anything wrong, but - you have to understand that he was abused by his previous owner and doesn't trust human a bit, therefore he regards punishment, aggression and violence differently - so, no punishment. What we do is that when he does something right, we give him treats and praise him (a little bit of drama and exaggeration involved); when he does something that we don't like, we show him that we don't like it and ignore him for a while. He wants to please you, so he will do anything if it makes you happy and avoid letting you down. For more details, kindly give me a call at during daytime."

Dodi,"This cutie answers to the name Dodi, and has a sweet temperament but is extremely manja. She has never been sick because she is a fully indoor cat. Highly pampered, Dodi has provided me and my wife with her charming company for more than five years. However, we have no choice but to re-home Dodi because due to our careers, my wife and I are planning to start life anew overseas in a few months. Furthermore, recently the management of my condo have started to pressure the residents about keeping pets and I am concerned that it is only a matter of time before Dodi can no longer stay in my apartment :( If you are interested to adopt Dodi, we would like to meet and interview you first. If you are chosen as Dodi's new master (or is it slave?), our only request is that you send us fortnightly video updates for awhile so that we can monitor Dodi's welfare. Note: Priority will be given to adopters who have no other pets because Dodi is quite a ""solo"" cat and does not play too well with others. We worry that she may get very stressed or traumatised if forced to live with other cats or dogs."

Oyen,"My partner found the abandon kitten and brought it home in February . We named it Oyen because of his color. He adapts immediately with my other 3 cats. Very friendly. Meows a lot, and follows me everywhere i go. His special skill is he can play fetch. Usually i throw a ball (crumpled paper), he will run and fetch it and bring it back to me. Since he stopped nursing at a very young age, he developed a habit of licking his own tummy. As much as I loved him, I am unable to support 4 adult cats indoor. Thus I am looking for a new owner for him. I would prefer if he is kept indoor, he has never been outdoor since. He already started to show signs of maturity, so best if send for neutering."

Kittens 1 Months Old,"Please help me to save these little kittens. there are two of them. 1 female and the other is male. both of them together with the mother are been hanging around in front of my office (in other words there living there). what i'm worried about is that they are very small and in front of my office is a parking lot area and i'm afraid they'll be hit while playing under the car (as you know kittens love to wondering around). some more there also dogs wondering around this area and it is not good for their safety. i think its ok if you just take the kittens without the mother because it seems that the mother started to leave her babies to play by themselves provided you have to feed them as babies i.e with milk to replace the mother's. i cannot keep or adopt them since i'm renting a room in my house and i don't think my house owner gonna like it. so, if somebody out there looking for pets,rather you buy expensive fluffy cats, please help me to save these little kittens because it will mean a lot to them also to me and in the same time you've done something good to the society and the animals. please please please help me to rescue them because i'm afraid the cleaner or the management of this building might done something bad to them because they have started littering everywhere it it cause a very bad smells and i'm afraid people might complain about this. if anyone interested kindly call me at my number ()or please email at . please let me know earlier so that i can keep them and put in the box while waiting for you to come and take them. i provide some of their photos. i know there are not a very fluffy cat or a Persian cats. but i bet they can be a very good friend."

The Manja Mr CrankyPants,"Mr CrankyPants is one of the cats in a feral colony that my neighbor and I care for. Unlike the others, he has become extremely tame and affectionate. While this is nice for us caretakers, it has made our sweet boy vulnerable to abuse. We suspect he has been intentionally harmed at least twice. Once he suffered a terrible wound on his chest that looked like he had been scalded with boiling water. More recently he became very ill and we think he was poisoned. Our neighbors have been complaining about the stray cats because they are pampered losers with nothing better to do with their lives. In light of these things against our little Cranks, it is with heavy hearts that we have decided to put him up for adoption. We love him but we are both full with our own pet cats and foster animals at the moment. I cannot afford to give him the quality of life that he so deserves and the attention that he craves. I think Mr CrankyPants would get along best as an only cat, or with a spayed female cat. I say this because he does not get along with the other male cats in the feral colony but he is just fine with the females. What's special about Cranks? Sure, he looks like an ordinary grey tabby but his personality is one in a million. He is the sweetest, most affectionate, and attention-seeking cat I have ever met and believe me I've met a lot of cats! He loves giving cuddles as much as he loves receiving them. When he has bonded to someone, he can't get enough of their love and he is never finished affectionately butting his head on you and expressing his gratitude. This cuddlebunny used to be the king of the colony but now he's a teddy bear. He's already been neutered and is healthy and toilet-trained. All that's left now is to find him his perfect human match. Could that be you? Would you like a kitty as sweet, loving, and loyal as a dog? Then Cranks is the one for you. Email or text me if you're interested. More pictures coming soon! He's pretty hard to photograph because he can't sit still! He's constantly rubbing his head on me and being super duper manja. Please, no caging except in instances of illness of injury. Cranks is a free spirit and he loves exploring."

She's an adorable dear, lies at your feet when hungry and may nibble your toes. I'm heartbroken to give her up but I doubt that I can afford quality and necessary care plus I have asthmatic allergies. I'm not expecting any payment but I hope she can be taken into a nice home and showered with love. If possible, neuter/spay her when the time comes. I'm also willing to pass on the items/tools/catfood I currently have to the next owner. As long as you're willing to take up the responsibility of a new furry companion :)"

Saffy (Saffron),"Hi, I have another adult female cat who had babies. They're all about 6 weeks old now so they should be able to be given away. This would probably be my last batch of kittens since I would finally want to spay my cat after this. I would like to keep them, but my current circumstances does allow me to so I'm hoping to find interested pet lovers. This one is named Saffron or Saffy for short. I named this batch after spices haha. At first she seemed meek but she's actually really friendly and curious and likes to walk and run around. She takes after her mother, Mimi. Saffy might need to be introduced to food slowly as she doesn't eat as much as her sibling, so be prepared with some kitten milk just in case and then give her wet food and slowly some dried ones. I'm currently training her and her siblings to use the litter box and it seems that they know where to do their business now so that's good. If interested in one, or more of them, please call/sms me at or email me. Unfortunately I don't have whatsapp, but if you need any additional pictures to be sent, please let me know your emails and I'll send them over."

T3,For Adoption
No Name,I rescued these 5 kittens where they about a week old and have been caring for them since. The plan was to raise them to be big and strong enough to be individually adopted. They are now big enough and it is becoming very difficult for me to continue handling all of them. They are all in good health and are very lively and adorable. Do take a look at some of their pictures and I hope you would at least fall in love with one. I did bring them fir deworming once but was advised to bring them for a second time. I however do not have the transport and resources to do so. All the kittens have been weaned from milk and can eat kibbles. Except for the one with the pink nose. She is a little small a requires a bit more attention when feeding. Further info will be provided if interested. Kittens are litter box trained. Still a little messy but will improve with time and age.

PF 15176  23-10-10,"Wed 13th Oct , 6:50 pm. Kitten could hv been fallen off from a moving vehicle. He crouched on the fast lane of the road near Kepong Central Station. I was on the second lane when I noticed a car at halt and hestitated to move. The road around 6pm - 7pm was very busy. Then I was astonished when I saw this little fellow there and the driver was trying to avoid it. Since the traffic was heavy and my second lane was also at halt, I went out and try to pick the fellow up. Well for all you know God was kind and as the little fellow started crawling under the car, the driver moved slowly. Other cars that followed also slowed down to see what was happening.As I neared the fellow it ran to the side of the divider and to the pavement. Luckily for this divider there was a big piece of land (pavement). Seeing that he was safe for a moment, I went back to my car and drove slightly up as I was blocking the traffic. Luckily I was able to park my car near a taxi stand. I took some cat food which I always have with me in my car and headed back to the kitten. When it saw me it ran away into an exposed drain. Oh! dear I thought, every where was covered up except this part and in he went. I inched up to him slowly making sure I do not frighten him.I extended my cat food to him and luckily this poor fellow was very hungry. It came for the food and I slowly caught hold of him. All the while I was praying to GOD to help and my prayer was answered. Thank You GOD Very smart fellow,tries to communicate to you."

√å¬ø' √å¬ø'\√å¬µ√ç¬á√å¬ø√å¬ø\ Maxwell 007,"Hello.. feline agent Maxwell here! ‚ô• My rescue story is a rough one. I strayed too far from home a few weeks ago and got lost. I eventually found myself at a gas station and meowed for days. By chance, late one night, a human on a routine fill decided to respond to my calls. ‚ô• I appeared happily out of a thicket and ran towards him. He tried to shoo me away (seeing that I looked like someone's pet) but I followed him persistently to his vehicle, making it clear that I wanted to be rescued. ‚ô• Fast forward a couple of weeks, despite several posters and shout-outs, no one has come to claim me. I'm now officially up for adoption. :) ‚ô• Take me not for a weakling! No part of anything I've endured has affected me in any way. I enjoyed my post-rescue car ride and even had a ball interacting with people during my checkup at the vets (I was given a clean bill of health). ‚ô• I'm downright outgoing, adaptable and sociable (that's not just around humans but cats and dogs too)! I love to play (strings and feather toys are my favorites) and when not playing, I enjoy a good cuddling with foster-mummy. WARNING: I have a deep meowing voice and purrs that will melt you to pulp! :) ‚ô• I'm careful with my weapons a.k.a claws and that makes me a great potential companion for kids too. ‚ô• I'm not fussy about food either (will eat kibbles or wet food). I have been vaccinated (first shot), dewormed, de-flead (with Revolution spot-on) and will soon be neutered. *** PLEASE READ: Note For Potential Adopters *** ‚óò Maxwell would like to be kept INDOORS full-time (if apartments, must be cat safe). ‚óò Maxwell would appreciate some form of premium food (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). This is for his long-term welfare. ‚óò Adoption fees will apply (to cover is neutering & vaccination cost). Please inquire. If you feel that you may be just the right person to take this lad home, please drop me an email or text at my number. Details on your past experience with cats will be much appreciated. :) Thank you!"
Beagle Mixed Dog,We have had Chloe since she was a puppy. She has been lovingly cared for and loves children. There is not an ounce of aggressiveness in her. Loves walks and will sit and wait for her food. I have taken a job overseas and my wife is not able to care for her with my two kids and a mother with alzheimers. My two kids are also confirmed to have some allergies hence cannot play with her for long. Its sad for me to let her go but I am hoping a kind family looking for a beautiful loving dog would consider having Chloe in their home.

We will be charging a fee of RM to cover his medical bill. If you are interested, please comment below or sms me. I will be in touch with you for a chat.

Brave,"This kitten which I named him Brave,was lying lifeless under the dark staircase of my condo. I guess Brave was not meant to end his life there, he managed to meow softly which somehow caught my attention. I quickly picked him up and was shocked to see that Brave was so skinny and could barely walk. Brave's body was so cold and his eyes were half opened. Without any hesitation, I used a thick towel to wrap him up and tried to hand feed him with some wetfood,he refused to eat, fed him with some milk and water, he refused to drink, Brave was simply too weak to eat and drink. Brave was infected by a virus similar to that of parvo virus in a dog. That night, Brave was just lying and closed his eyes with heavy breath and i thought that he might not be able to make it to the next day. However, in the middle of the night, i heard a soft meow, it was Brave ! he was meowing to me ! he managed to raise up his little head eventhough he still could not stand up and walk. Immediately, i fed him some milk and water and he drank ! i monitored Brave's condition throughout the night (he was having severe diarrhea as well) and rushed him to the vet, Dr. Tan (2nd chance panel vet) the next morning. Dr. Tan said by looking at Brave's terrible condition and based on her experience, normally kitten infected with this kind of virus and with such a low body temperature as well as severe diarrhea, Brave had a very low chance to pull through. Brave was hospitalised and continue to be monitored and i, already prepared to receive call from the Dr. Tan anytime about the bad news on Brave, However, Brave has such a strong will to live, he began to perk up the next day, he can stand up and walk, he started to eat and drink by himself ! Yesterday, i dropped by at the clinic and Dr. Tan said that Brave's temperature has gone back to normal despite a bit of a diarrhoea. Brave not only ate and drank on his own, he even walked out from the cage and greeted me with a loud meow ! After a while, he started to groom himself ! What a joy! So, this is a wonderful and happy story about Brave and i hope that someone can foster Brave or better still, adopt him ! because Brave definitely deserves to be loved, doesn't he ? I hope that someone is kind enough to foster him. if he is not adopted, at least he is under the good hands of the fosterer and until the time that he is totally recovered and strong enough, i have to put Brave back to his colony. i hope Brave is fit and strong enough to be a community cat at my condo. Brave is really a miracle to me, he really wants to survive and he does ! Try to look at the pictures that i attached, his eyes are full of fighting spirit.......... Interested parties and strictly for cat lovers only, pls call Mei Leng at"

"Tiger, Simba","My incredibly handsome cat whose name is Tiger recently got neutered, he is friendly and loves to eat. Tiger's bestfriend, Simba is pampered and likes attention. However, she has not been neutered. It all started with a stray cat that keeps coming for food, she soon after gave birth at our house and started her own family generation. Simba's mother on the other hand, was a kitten when I found her at my backyard. My house currently has 11 cats, 5 of which are newborn kittens. We love cats but it's too much for us to handle as we have other responsibilities to attend to. Looking for anyone who is keen to adopt our adorable cats and take good care of them. May God bless your soul and return your kindness. :)"

"Delta, Lambda, Epsilon And Sigma","Our cat, Kontit gave birth to these kittens on the 22nd of January, so they are all just a little under 2 months old. All are healthy, friendly and playful. All kittens have long tails. We already have two grown cats and due to the nature of our work, we can't afford the time to take care of these playful little ones. They need someone to play with and take care of them. Main characteristics: Delta: Female,slightly yellowish brown face with darker brown upper body and black stripes; white under body and booties. Playful and friendly. Lambda: Female, colour is similar to Delta, but her the tip of her tail is bushier. Playful and friendly. Epsilon/Tiger: Female, greyish brown fur with more distinguished black stripes, and white under body and booties. Black patch on left side of snout (near whiskers). A little shy compared to the other kittens but playful. Sigma: Male, greyish dark brown fur coat, light brown under body with darker stripes. Smallest of all the kittens. Playful and friendly."

She is playful, very cute and behave and she has a good appetite. I wish I can keep her but I already have 3 cats plus my busy schedule so for me that is enough. I hope Tiny will find a great owner and good home that will love her."
Ninja,"When I search through the cats on petfinder for adoption, my heart sank as most cats are cuter, younger and prettier than Ninja. Though I personal understand that chances of him being adopted is as close as 0, but deep down inside me I still hope someone who will have a big heart for him. Ninja is not special or pretty, but in my eyes, he is not any lesser than other prettier cats. He is 6-year-old now, and has never parted with me as he was born in my wardrobe and been with me since then. His mom was a stray that I used to feed and without me knowing she creeped into my wardrobe and gave birth to 3 beautiful babies. Unfortunately his mom passed away after 2 weeks, sent to the vet when found she Ill but was too late to treat. I bottle fed him since the day his mom crossed the bridge. I have 4 cats of my own and I'm being relocated to SG and could only bring 2 cats with me due to circumstances. I would eventually follow my husband to Australia in a few years time from SG and can't afford the expensive pet relocating cost. It kills me to pick which 2 among 4 of them. I'm brining the oldest and Ninja's sister (ex-sporo survival) simply because 1 being the oldest and the other one being an ex sporo patient. Ninja is a very quiet and independent cat. He doesn't like to be held much or pat. It takes a really big heart to love him unconditionally as he is not the huggable type. He needs a permanent home with an owner who loves him despite being a little too 'cool'. I hope someone out there will have a space at home and a big heart to take him in and love him. Anyone who likes to find out more about Ninja may drop me messages on whatsapp at (Michelle)"

Anna And Elsa,"They were born at the vet when a kind rescuer rescued their mother Coco. The mum found a home along with their brother Panther. They were adopted twice but they have had unsuitable adopters. After that they were moved to a fosterer's house, who is no longer available to keep them. They both feel they are not loved or wanted. They may look big in size, but are very sweet and loving. They are also able to follow simple commands, sit, down, etc and are in the midst of learning more. It would be great if they can be adopted together but they are independent enough to be separated. So interest in either are welcome. I am not the fosterer or the rescuer, but am helping my friend to get them adopted. I personally agree that they can be very sweet and are quite trainable if you spend some time with them. If you have the hearts and space for this two fellas, do contact this number ) or message me. Thank you!"

Muddy & Sandy,"""We used to live with our mummy, and a lot of friends together with this homeless uncle in Balakong. There were people who stop by to give us food and talk to the uncle. One day, there was this lady who dropped by to give us some kibbles. After that, this lady visited us every week and was asking a lot about us as our hind legs are different from the rest. She took us to the vet to get us checked, dewormed and vaccinated. This lady will take us and return us to the uncle after going to vet every week. Unfortunately, in between the duration, our brother, Woody got hit by a motorcycle and passed away, and we were very sad. This lady took us back and her friend is currently fostering us. We have a lot of friends there, even cats! But sadly, her friend is not able to care for us any more."" I am looking for a good home for Muddy and Sandy. They will follow you like a lamb and are quite obedient. They love to snuggle with each other. Muddy is very loyal and a good guard dog while Sandy is very jovial and have a happy-go-lucky attitude. Both are swimmer pups, affecting Muddy's hind legs and Sandy's one hind leg, however, they behave like normal dogs and without complications. A family with teenagers or grown up kids, or a retired couple would be great for Muddy and Sandy. Preferably someone who has experience with mixed breed dogs (not only breed dogs), and know how to care for them. They are the kind of dog who feels like a real companion when you come home from work. They keep up with you and keep going - dancing in appreciation. I would love to have Muddy and Sandy adopted together as they are siblings and they are all grown up now. Preferably to be adopted within Klang Valley or Ipoh. Rescuer has relocated overseas."

Mi Cai 2,New born baby cats 2 weeks time..at my house all five of them are males
Leshem,"Location : Selangor, Malaysia Name : Leshem. Names meaning : Precious. Gender : Male. Birth date : Approximately Dec . Vaccination : 1st - done. Potty training : Trained (on potty tray & garden). Terms & conditions as follow :- ‚Ä¢ to sign an adoption form. ‚Ä¢ MUST be neutered when he is 8 months old. The adoption fee is a deposit for the neutering fees. Adopter can choose to send him back to us for spaying at 8 months old or prove to us that neutering is done by showing the incision part & the vet written proof and we will refund the balance after paying/deducting the neutering fee. ‚Ä¢ we will send to adopter's house. ‚Ä¢ to be kept indoor. ‚Ä¢ allow us to visit once in a while. ‚Ä¢ vaccinations to be follow up. ‚Ä¢ medical needs to be given if needed in future. ‚Ä¢ no caging/on leash for long hours. ‚Ä¢ return to us/inform us if he were to be given to another person. ‚Ä¢ updates via whatsapp/email/Facebook/Instagram/house visit from time to time. ‚Ä¢ to be fed on proper food with proper nutrition meant for dogs. ‚Ä¢ love him as a part of the family. Kindly contact us directly from Petfinder message or private message us at Facebook (Lohicr) or message/whatsapp us at the contact number provided if interested. You can also help us to find a forever loving home for this sweetheart by clicking the SHARE button and share it with your friends or family that are interested in adopting him. Much appreciated. ------------------------------------ His story : Was rushing to an appointment and saw this lil one hiding under a red car at an area that we are familiar with. Got a friend to check him out while I rush to my appointment and he was not found. After 9 hours, passed by again and saw him at the exact same spot waiting. Once I stopped my car, he came towards me wagging his tail. I'm VERY sure this is a dumping case, because there is no strays around or pregnant female dogs at the nearest strays area. This is what humans are capable of. He is probably just 4 months old, don't even know what is going on or how to fend for himself. He has got dandruff all over his top fur. And he looks so hungry. We named him Leshem, meaning precious. Because life is precious no matter in which form. He has been treated at the vet, showered, dewormed and vaccinated. He is back home with us now while waiting for a forever home he can count on as family. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets."
5,very loving kitten and loves to eat :D
Puppies Looking For A Loving Home,"Two adorable puppies were rescued off the streets with their Mommy. The Mommy has a home now, but the owner doesn't want the puppies. If you can give them a home, a nice loving home it will be great. These two are siblings and they get along really well. It would be best if you can take them both in. They are loving, boisterous darlings that just need someone to love them back. Even at such a young age, they are both great guard dogs. They are brave and not afraid. With a little bit of training, they'll make good pets and guard dogs. I only have ONE request. Only take them if you are serious about adopting them. They will live to be about 15 years old. Can you dedicate that time to them? You must commit to spaying/neutering both of them at 5 months old. This will help prevent further stray problems. I am only interested in SERIOUS adopters, not those with passing fancies. The fee indicated is for deworming them. If you really want them, you won't mind the RM80. NOTE: I work in Singapore so I won't be able to answer your calls during the day. Kindly send me an sms if you're interested and I will get back to you at night. Alternatively, you can email me at or SMS me at +65."

Unfortunately this dog died and Sassy decided to feed this new litter of puppies. She was also very protective of this litter of puppies that she whined whenever my dad and I tried to take them away (so sweet right?). She managed to nurture 2 puppies back to health but the rest died. We took her in after a while and she was an amazing pet. She is so tame and was able to learn the rules in our house in no time (much faster than my own dogs). She is loving and a wonderful guard dog. Unfortunately we have to give all our dogs a way.

Mou Mou,"Since Nov 14 I saw a furry kid has skin problems hair lost, and then I decided to help him and provide medicine and food to eat . After two weeks the furry kid skin look getting better and grow 95% hair back . Every morning the owner of the shop at town will try to kick the furry kid away, poor furry kid have no place to go sometime just stand in the middle of the road or just hide under the vehicle to rest. And furry kid is new coming to the town, here have other stray dog I‚Äôm worry they will fight and also worry one day city council will come to catch them and kill him . The furry kid behaved very playful, before that he was afraid that he would flee approaching strangers, I try use food to approach him and feed him, I try to touch him then he slowly accept me and let me touch him. Now every night when he heard the familiar sound of my car he will run over to me, he knows is time for his dinner and the happiness moment. Then I'll try to take a few minutes to play with him, he was very happy and running and jumping around me.

No Name,Found an abandoned old dog with 10 puppies. 8 puppies are dead as the mother dog has no milk. Only 2 survived. Looking for fosterer urgently as I am renting a room and unable to take care of them due to work commitments.

Kayla,"Introducing Kayla! _________________________________________________ Details: ‚ô• Female, 10 months old, Irish Wolfhound + Border Collie mix. She has a rough medium length coat (black and white). ‚ô• Kayla is under foster care as her family had to travel overseas due to unforeseen circumstances. Kayla is now seeking a permanent new family. _________________________________________________ Character: ‚ô• Kayla is an intelligent and high energy dog. She loves taking walks (especially running around fields, beaches, hiking, etc). If you're an active person, she will happily tag along on a leash as you do your daily runs/cycling/etc. :) ‚ô• DESPITE her energy; Kayla is a VERY calm dog when indoors! She will only get onto beds/sofas if invited and otherwise makes herself comfy where she can. ‚ô• Kayla understands a few commands like ""sit"", ""stay"" and ""shake"". She was also trained to wait for her food and walk off leash by her previous owners (however I have not followed up on this during the period of foster care). ‚ô• She has an amazing temperament too! Gets along well with dogs (cats also if she sees them indoors/as part of the family. Kayla is especially patient and loving around children, She's the type of dog that would lie in bed with the kids and keep them feeling safe/protected. ‚ô• Kayla requires NO grooming whatsoever as her fur stays the length it already is. She also hardly ""smells"" and only needs a bath once a month at most if indoors (unless she's really had a muddy run somewhere or rolled where she shouldn't). ‚ô• Kayla loves water too! She will half-sit in a pool, even chase after water sprinkling out of a hose. :) ‚ô• Potty habits; When indoors, Kayla will bark 3 - 4 times in a row to let her people know she needs to be let out to do her business. She appreciates routine daily walks (at least once in the morning, another in the evening before bedtime). ‚ô• Kayla is fully vaccinated (rabies shots included). She is also spayed, parasite free and micro-chipped. She is not fussy about food either. _________________________________________________ *** PLEASE READ (Note for potential adopters) *** ‚ô• Kayla takes time to adjust to new people (at least 2 weeks to trust). She will bond closely to anyone who pays the most attention to her. She will accept ""firm"" tones when being trained but NO rough tones/scolding of any kind. ‚ô• Kayla likes being indoors % EXCEPT when she needs to be taken out for some form of activity. Adopters practicing this are preferred. ‚ô• Kayla needs round the clock attention (she will get anxious if left crated any longer than 4 hours a day). Adopters with lots of time on their hands are her best preference. ‚ô• An adoption fee will apply to cover Kayla's basic care (please inquire). Her cards will be passed to successful adopters. :) _________________________________________________ Please drop me a call or email if interested in taking this girl home. Details on your past experience with dogs will be much appreciated. Thank you!"

Beautiful Grey Mix-Persian Kitten,"This beautiful mix-Persian kitten has soft, fluffy grey fur (dense undercoat) and a long tail. The most remarkable thing about him is his very sweet and beautiful face. What makes him more special though is that his personality mirrors his face: he is sweet, gentle and affectionate (manja). He will rush after you to play and be stroked and cuddled. He is very well-trained with cat litter and is a good and obedient cat (not overly playful or boisterous). He will grow up to be a very handsome and large cat (following his persian side) because even now he is bigger than most domestic kittens his age. I hope to find him a good, loving home with people who will love him and can give him good quality cat food and chicken meat (his favourite :)as well as the ability to afford a vet visit if neccessary. Pls note: I must be honest and emphasize that he is a very fussy eater. He doesn't like cat biscuits and will only eat canned food if mixed with boiled chicken or fish meat. And not given the food he likes he will hardly eat and grow thin. He also has a sensitive stomach and if not given quality food (that means no table scraps) he will have diarrhoe. Despite all this his beauty, his playfulness and his very affectionate personality makes me hard to part with him but if you feel you can give him a better home...pls contact me. The money you pay for him is not for me to profit but will go a long way to help the other cats under my care."
Angel,"Angel had severe glaucoma resulting in the surgical removal of one eye last week. She lives as a stray and is fed by a kind lady. Since she only has one eye now, it would be so good if someone can adopt her as a home-pet. She is of very good temperament, is sociable and loving."
Bro @ Sis,"Mama cat chased away by the four dogs i feed in the factory, and left them while they were just about 3 weeks old, one male and one female.

I've been foster them over 5 weeks and now ready for adoption.Please do consider to adopt both of them, I currently look after over 20 of dogs and cats, or they would have to be with me almost 24/7 in cage! For more details please directly contact or sms me, thanks!"

Mr Fluffers And Cocochino,"Mr Fluffers and Cocochino were rescued from the streets of my neighborhood with their mother and sister a few months ago. They are two little beauties with the smoothest, glossiest fur i have ever touched. These brothers are extremely close and I want them to be ADOPTED TOGETHER. Mr fluffers is the leader of the two as he is more daring, outgoing, and openly affectionate. Cocochino harbors some fear of strangers and it took him a long time to warm up to me. He follows what his brother does all the time. So, when he sees that fluffers and i are having fun together, he loosens up and joins in. He loses his fear when he is together with fluffers, separate them and his fears return. If you are looking for INDOOR cats and don't mind their high energy play, you can call me at . Adopter must be a very patient person as Cocochino will not be immediately friendly, must be willing to put in effort to build a relationship with these boys, a true cat lover. The succesful adopter will have to reimburse me for Mr Fluffers and Cocochino's neutering and vaccinations at which point i will hand over their medical booklets. This means the adopter must pay me back for what i have spent on their neutering and vaccinations. I don't make a profit. They have received their first and second vaccinations. Diet: Acana Kitten kibble, Natural Balance canned food. Litter trained: Use the litter box without fail. Grooming: Because they've got pretty long hair, they may need occasional grooming. Neutered: /08"

Blessed,"2 months ago, this small skinny black puppy (with a streak of white on her chest) under a car with serious maggots infested head injury was found. With the help of a vet, we have nursed her to good health and the wound has healed. She is now around 3 1/2 months old. We named her Blessed as she is a blessing to whichever home she goes to. She is easy to look after and does not bark unnecessarily. She is toilet trained to do it on underpad indoor at the moment, as advised by the vet; we have to separate her from other dogs during her healing period. She is such a fighter against all odds despite the serious injury at such an early tender age of her life. She is growing up to be a beautiful and loving girl. Blessed is being place with a fosterer pending rehoming. Unfortunately, the kind fosterer has just been told by her landlord to have all the dogs removed from the house immediately or to vacate the house by this week (28/4/13). As such, we are seeking kind adopter to give Blessed a chance to have a loving home immediately after having just a hard life on the street. Please call/sms WM Cheong ( )"

Lucy,This little girl was catch and place in a box by the management staff at my office without any food inside the box. It breaks my heart to see her inside the box trying to escaped so I brought her back to my apartment to foster her while looking for a new adopter. She seems not so happy living inside the apartment maybe because she used to be free kitty. i wish I can take care of her but i can't because i'll be away from 8th sept and only will be back by the end of September. So i really hope someone can adopt her and give her love that he deserve. she is very friendly and love to sleep beside you at night.i know that she can become a very good companion to you. anyone interested can whatsapp or call me. i stay in kelana Jaya near paradigm mall. i only have 2 photos of her and will update soon more interesting shot.

Micky,"A few days ago, my son & I found this little kitty when we went for a swim, she was alone walking by the pool, and without thinking we decided to take her home. We aren't really sure how old she is, maybe about 5 months. We named her Micky. She is an adorable active girl and likes to keep herself busy exploring her surroundings and chasing her kitty toys. She likes to sleep on higher places like desk and fridge. Micky loves attention and is very affectionate. Unfortunately, we cannot keep Micky as our circumstances have changed recently, so we are looking for a good home for Micky. We are also looking for an exceptional good home for Smokey, a handsome man of whom we adopted about a year ago from Ms Mills. For more info about Smokey, please go to Micky and Smokey can be adopted together or separately."
No Name,"This puppy is: 1. Female 2. 3 months old 3. White mixture with Brown in colour 4. very cute, healthy and active 5. In Penang A lot of people will think that female dogs will dirty the place or cause male dogs to come when they have period. In actual fact, once the female dogs are spayed, they will not have period any more(The spaying cost is not expensive if you go for government vet). Moreover, my experience is female dogs are easier to be trained for toileting. The conditions for adoption are: 1. Deworm and vaccinate it immediately after you adopt it. 2. Spay it when it's more than 6 months old if you do not want to see abandoned puppies. 3. Treat the puppy with love and make it be part of your family."

I call one of them Pepper; she is a small to mediumship dog, female, is all black with a strip of white on her chest, medium brown eyes and approx around 1-2 years old. Her pup I named Hazel; she's less than 6 months, all light caramel hazel brown with stunning green brown eyes. They are both very playful and loving and have already been spayed,vaccinated and deformed as I brought them to the vet immediately. They were also very obedient at the vets and even scratched at the door to go potty outside then came back in!! Please if anyone is able to give these two dogs a home they deserve please contact me ASAP as they are currently being housed in a not so great environment offered by the vet as there is no room for them at any of the rescue shelters. I would obviously take them both in to my home in Canada but am not able to do so as I already have a dog who is very aggressive to other dogs. Please save their lives and yes I would to keep the two of them together not only because they are mother and daughter but because all they have is each other and that's how they were when I found them.

KIKI Lala Wawa Yaya,"These four fursiblings were originally from a pack of five but one pup died after being hit by a car where their mother abandoned them. Too sad. They were rescued at one month plus by a kind lady who brought them to me in two batches and now being fostered at my house. They will make good guard dogs and their barks even made my two grown dogs retreated a few steps. Kiki is the biggest of them four and he is the laid-back brother he can fall asleep anywhere and anytime even when his head was on top of the tap. Eat and sleep is Kiki's motto. However when challenged, Kiki will step up and protect his sisters and stand in front and bark. Lala is a feisty one she barks the loudest yet she is a softie inside. Her ears are the most unique pointy to the sides unlike her siblings and she loves any kind of food you serve her. Wawa is the prettiest and smallest in size but she gives you a good fight and will be good in guarding your house with her high pitched bark. Wawa looks the most different from all of them and her coat is similar to a Doberman. Yaya is the most animated and active of them all. She is keen to explore and the first to warm up to humans after they were rescued. Yaya is the most intelligent of them all as she picks up cue faster than her siblings. To prevent more strays please neuter and spay your pups once they are six months old. FOR SERIOUS ADOPTERS ONLY. Please provide them with a loving home with minimal caging and adequate attention and care. A dog's loyalty is for life."

Abu Nawas,"My friend rescued this kitten & I took care of it. Abu Nawas has been bathe so he has no fleas. He needs some love & sadly, I can't give it to him( as much as I want to) because my own cats do not get well with him :( I want him to have a loving home."

Puma /Tiger,"Puma, a cute active kitten. Love to play and sleep so much.Need to give away since i already have a few cats and stayed in apartment.It will be best if you can adopt the female sibling(named Tiger) so that they can play together and not alone.Same age. They are all litter box-trained. P/S: prefer self pickup"
Jaws,"Jaws was rescued by two independent rescuers from a busy road at times square. She's believed to have been dumped by her previous owners as she has a leash mark around her neck. Jaws has a minor deformity in her jaw as the lower jaw is shorter than her upper jaw. She is a very sweet and loving girl and needs a family that can commit to taking care of her for the rest of her life. She will be dewormed, vaccinated and spayed as soon as the vet confirms she's ready. Adopter cannot cage or chain her for long periods of time Only serious adopters will be entertained."
Nameless,"my neighbour daughter brought this stray kitten from gurney drive but was unable to cope with it. so we took him home to foster till he got strong and healthy. 1) feed him with good food and original salmon sashimi cod treat until his skin and coat become healthy and shinning. 2) very close to human, make eyes contact and like to be carried and pat. purring most of the time. 3) smart, playful and clever with the litter-box."
Princess,"For serious adopters only! If you are interested in adopting, kindly contact ==> Call/ SMS/ Whatapps to Requirements for Adoption: ========================= All adoptions are subject to an interview and house check. Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY."
Snowflake,"I just found Snowflake at a local Tesco carpark, earlier today. He was so hungry and thirsty but he could not find any food or drink there. I brought him home afraid that he might get hit by a car. There was also no sign of him having siblings or a mother. He is very healthy and is able to eat dried food, kibbles, or even wet food. He is already litter-trained. Besides that, he is very active and loves to explore new environment. At this young age, he is extremely playful and he keeps interacting with me as well as giving my cat kisses. However, i can only foster him for another week as i will be leaving Malaysia next week. Hopefully, someone will adopt him before i leave. The current location is Tronoh, Perak. I could deliver him to Ipoh or Penang or other states for free if you are really interested in keeping him. For fast response, contact me via PM."
No Name,"Hi its a kitten found in high school desk during school opening.Very cute and manja 3 color kitty , anyone willing to adopt this kitty plz contact~ Thanks for viewing~"
California,"California showed up at my front porch in June but my cat-owning neighbours do not know who she belongs to so she's likely dumped. As a result, I decided to spay her and rehome her since she's still young. - She has no tail deformity unlike most other domestic cats. - She was dewormed by a vet on 20 June . - She has been applied with Revolution on 5 August to protect her against ticks, fleas, ear mites, heartworms & intestinal worms for a month. - Her weight is 4.15 kg as at 7 August , a gain of 0.65kg since 10 July . - I'm feeding her with premium dry cat kibbles. - She can drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the cat to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage her health and shorten her life. - She's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using pine litter which is good for her (& human's) health and the environment. - Her poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as her overall health. - She has been spayed on 28 June at a cost of RM. - She has been vaccinated on 10 July at a cost of RM50. - Booster vaccination and deworming on 7 August at a cost of RM68. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. 2) The cat must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate her yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM50 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only partially cover the RM spaying, vaccination & deworming costs which I'm subsidising. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. If you're interested to adopt California, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first."
Donut,"For more pics go here: 9th April edit: I have revised the adoption fee to RM to include the fee I paid her breeder. The reason I am now making reimbursement of the breeder's fee compulsory is to help out Malaysian Dogs Deserve Better (MDDB) - they are currently in dire financial straits (read this for details and please help if you can: ). Previously if Donut's adopter voluntarily reimbursed the breeder's fee I had planned to donate the RM to MDDB anyway, since they really need funding I reckon a sincere adopter won't mind the expense as it's going to a good cause. 6th April edit: The family who intended to adopt Donut backed out due to personal reasons (hectic things going on in their lives, nothing to do with Donut herself). So this bundle of beagle-y joy is up for adoption again! :) 5th March edit: I have had people contact me asking if she's old enough to mate. Apparently some people can't read - DONUT HAS BEEN SPAYED. Meaning she can't get pregnant. If you want to adopt her with the intention of breeding her, don't bother contacting me. Donut is an affectionate beagle that loves human and canine company. Trained to do toileting on grass and knows a few tricks - sit, paw, high five, up, down, stand, responds to her name and stays on command in the presence of food. Well socialised and impervious even to thunderstorms (she will calmly snooze under whichever car's in the porch whereas my adult dog will be running around in a panic)! She has some good and bad traits typical of beagles. The good: She's a pack animal as beagles are bred to be and therefore gets along well with other dogs (plays happily with my lab pup and even my temperamental adult mutt). Very friendly even with new people - strangers are constantly delighted when they approach her. The bad: She loves digging holes in the garden (a common problem with beagles). So if you love gardening and your lawn must look immaculate she is not the dog for you. She will also chew stuff you leave lying around which is typical behaviour for all teething puppies. 9th April edit: This isn't necessarily a good/bad thing as it's a natural inclination due to her breed (beagles were originally bred to hunt), but forgot to mention, Donut has a high prey drive when it comes to small animals and cannot be trusted unsupervised with them. She has killed squirrels and birds that wandered into my garden so if you have small animals as pets in your home (rabbits/hamsters/sugar gliders etc.) she would not be a good fit. She's curious and friendly with adult cats when supervised but I would not advise keeping her if you have kittens as I'm not sure if she might mistake them for prey to hunt due to their small size. For those who might wonder why this lovely dog is up for adoption: She is the product of an irresponsible breeder - I'd rather not go into details because remembering how she came into being in my care makes me mad =/ Initially I was hoping to keep her but being a person who believes one should spend a lot of quality time with his/her dog, I've reluctantly come to the conclusion that with 2 dogs of my own I just cannot give Donut the attention she deserves. I spend at least 2 hours a day with my dogs - my opinion is that if you only have time to feed your dog and give it a quick pat as you leave for work/return, then you do not have enough time for a dog. I hope she will find a loving home where love can be lavished on her instead of her present situation where she is receiving limited attention. Adoption fee is for covering her vaccination (she has had the full set of shots) and spaying costs. On top of those expenses I had to pay off the breeder to have Donut released to me (otherwise the breeder would have dumped her at SPCA or pawned her off to the first willing buyer who may have turned out to be a backyard breeder). If you are a serious adopter and able to reimburse me for the breeder's fee (RM) this would be greatly appreciated - I will donate the reimbursed amount to a dog rescue organisation. [PLEASE NOTE the 9th April edit on top of this listing - the breeder's fee is now compulsory.) I am going to be blunt and state upfront that I can afford to be very selective about the home she goes to and will be. After all, pedigreed dogs are more popular (I wish more people would love mixed breeds just as much, but this is the unfortunate reality) and I am in no hurry rehome her. My priority is finding Donut a home where she will receive more love and attention than I can give her at the moment. Bearing the above in mind, these are my conditions for adoption: 1. You MUST have time for her. Donut thrives on attention - when I first fostered her she had separation anxiety and would whine and howl if there were no humans or dogs to keep her company (with training she is now a confident dog). As such I strongly prefer a home where there is a friendly dog for companionship. If Donut will be the only dog in the household, I would prefer if the household has someone able to give her constant attention (i.e. retiree/homemaker/work-at-home/kids). 2. No tying or caging up (unless you find a constantly howling beagle particularly enjoyable....). 3. Adoption fee of RM to cover medical costs and breeder's fee. 4. Patience with destructive behaviour that is inevitable with all puppies. 5. Maintain her on a premium kibble (she is currently on Orijen)/raw food diet. 6. Allow me to visit in the beginning to check on her wellbeing (as such I am looking for adopters in the KL/Selangor area so that this is possible). 7. Lavish her with love, love and more love! :) I would appreciate it if you could email a brief intro of yourself, your experience with dogs if any, which area you live in, your household situation (what type of home you live in, whether you have other family members/friends living with you etc.) and why you would like to adopt Donut. I will get back to you with my contact number for further discussion."

For all she had done for the kids, we are looking for a home to give her all the tender loving care in the world, every bit of which she deserves. Please e-mail for inquiries and do spread the word. Thank you."

Coco,"I found this puppy nearby Pejabat Cawangan MBSA Kota Kemuning after my morning appointment nearby, i fed it some kibbles and she is very active and adorable. She is very alert and extremely smart and very playful as well.So far she has been vaccinated and dewormed. Interested adopters MUST get her spayed when she is 6 months old to prevent uterus cancer and other health complications when she is older, that way we can ensure she will live a long and healthy life and also will not reproduce anymore."
Coco Chanel,"‚ô• Coco, 8 weeks old, tortie-lynx point with blotches of gray / cream / white and blue eyes. Father was a Ragdoll and mother is an American Curl (given up by previous owners while pregnant). ‚ô• Coco is a sweet-pea and has a true inherited Ragdoll nature where she goes limp if carried! She can likely be taught to be a lap-kitten, enjoys strokes and being baby-talked. She is the best climber and learns things real quick! Loves toys (especially feathered ones) and adventure - she also has an odd-obsession with watching us cleaning out the litter box (and sometimes getting in there to ""help"" us). ‚ô• She's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Coco must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - She's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Spaying is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets. If you feel that you may be just the right person for this girl, please drop me a message with details about yourself and your experience with cats (via WhatsApp or email). Thank you!"
Dumi,"I have a male cat named Dumi,a very very manja and shy cat. I rescued him a few years ago.Reason to let go is that, now I'm not always home due to working out of state (be home once a week) and I am moving to a new house soon(no pets allowed by the owner,we have to limit the number of cats we own and my husband is the only one home he works extra hours so the cats may be neglected)...so I need someone that really care and patient enough to look after him,give all the love he needs,a cat lover. He is neutered so new owner doesn't have to worry about him peeing around or misbehaving because he is the most shy and well-behaved cat u'll ever met.Most importantly he is litter-trained,behaved well for long-distance journey/trips coz I used to always carry him around if I travel. Need to rehome Dumi asap.Adopter MUST be cat lover and has cat friendly home.Adopter should be a very responsible owner who's willing to give Dumi time and space to adapt to new home..

Kyra,"It is with a heavy heart that I write this. Due to physical and time constraints, I have had to make the hard decision of letting Kyra go. I've only had her for about four months, but due to a serious leg injury, I'm unable to give her the attention that she deserves. KYRA was a shop dog in horrid condition. She had bad teeth, bad claws, and horrible skin. Even so, she is a bubbly, energetic pup with so much love to give. She is a high energy, bouncy dog, and quite simple in the head in terms of the way she plays. Kyra knows how to SIT, LIE DOWN, and knows how to wait for her meals. She has been treated for heartworm, dewormed, and had extensive treatment for a serious case of demodex. Kyra has NO aggression issues, and I hope to find someone with a big heart and home to take her in."

Guana,"I love Guana alot. Guana Description: 1) She is very active, she likes to run alot. So everyday I take her to a padang to run. Sometimes she might be hyperactive, jumping on you licking u nonstop etc. 2) She is very attach to People/ Owners. at the same time very playful with other dogs, can mingle well. 3) She will guard you door at night, barks at strangers walking past or walking close. In the morning sometimes she barks at passerby, but most of the day-time she sleeps. 4) Not yet very Obediant but very very trainable (with doggy Treats and Cane, depending on situation). She is trained not to bite shoes already (but sometimes she still flings it around for fun, but wont chew on it). 5) Can understand Simple words like: ""Guana~"", ""Sit/ Sitdown"", ""Hand/ Shakehand"", ""Come"", ""NO!"", ""Da Da Le!!""(Means Beat Beat in Chinese), 6) Will chase cats (Chase Only). Wont bite cats, will only surround/ trap it at a corner and bark at it non stop. Will stop kaciao-ing the cat if you yell ""Guana NOo!!"". The Reason she hate cats is once she got Clawed by a stray cat, at first she wants to make friends with it wagging her tail jumping around her, then CLAWW!!!. Now she hate them species.  The Reasons I am giving her up for adoption. 1) WORK- My working life has increase in activitivities, I have to go outstation or out of country alot more now (for days, weeks, coming project need to leave msia for a month :[ ). No more 9-5 job. Hiah. things Change so suddent. 2) Family- Suddently Parents decided to come back from overseas, and plan to stay in Msia for a long time. So means Garage park one more car= less space for guana to run. And they dont like Dogs, If I am not around they wont walk my dog. Most they did so far is fed her (very reluctantly) when I am not around. They are ok with her(wont hurt or scold her), but I know in their mind they see her as a burden. * What She needs now is Friends. Sometimes I can feel her loneliness. I feel sad. When she has a friend she can play many many hours with it and wont get tired. * Training her with tid bids and snacks are more effective than cane. Cane should only be use as a threatning gesture only. Only use it when she did something very wrong on purpose. * Maybe I am spoiling her too much. Hmmmm. * You can Change name if you like, as she is still young. some commands she still havent fully understand. Sometimes she dosent respond to her own name. * Feel free to take her feeding n drinking bowl, leash, collar and her remaining dog food. Let me know. If u want or dont want the things. * Hopefull I can find a genuine adopter before I leave on a short(9days) outstation trip on the 25th feb. But has to be adopted before 16th march before my taiwan (3weeks)business trip.  I Hope someone will understand my situation as there are so many unprecidented sudden changes in my life lately. I am Sorry to all that is reading this, because I could not continue taking care of her as my work will get even busier in the weeks to come. Hope a Genuine good adopter will take Guana in to their family (prefer people with dog(s) already, I dont want her to be lonely)."
Sammy,"Sammy is an inquisitive little fella with light blue eyes. He's always poking his nose into everything and loves to run around my garden. He's a really fast runner! His flowery coat of hair on his body is so long and fluffy, just like his brother Teddy. His coat pattern looks like a Siberian Husky, the cat version! Sammy is rescued along with his mother (Maddie) and brother and sister (Teddy and Little Champ). He's about 6 weeks old. (26 March ) I had him dewormed and treated for fleas and ear mites and also bathed him clean. Please call if you can give him a loving home. New owner must promise to have him neutered at 6 month old."

He knows how to use the litter box and likes a lot of attention. He doesn't really get along with other cats at first so be warned if you have other cats in the house.

They would have been washed away by the river water in a thunderstorm if not for him. 7 are adopted. These 2 are still being nursed by their mother in the light industrial area in USJ 1. I hope to get homes them too or they will end up as strays. They may not survive long as strays because the area where they are, is not safe. A pup from a previous litter of the same mother died hiding from other dogs, in the bushes at the river bank. All I ask is please treat them with kindness and compassion till GOD wants them back. Letting them live their life out in a cage or being tied up is a big no for me. Dog lovers please call me at ."

Midnite May,"I found May (on 6th May ) outside a sundry shop, alone and tiny with no siblings or mum cat around. She was just 3 weeks old. She was totally approachable when I picked her up. Took her to vet for some fungal infection treatment on her back and limbs and dewormed (8th May). She has fully recovered from any skin infections (luckily it was mild) and her fur has fully grown back to shiny black! She eats with a very good appetite and has been fed daily with soft food and now with good set of teeth she's nibbling on kitten kibbles. Was only the length of a TV remote control and now more than doubled up that size! Very playful, super active and adorable kitty. She is roaming freely upstairs/downstairs and everywhere cos she is very disciplined when it comes to her toilet habit and so far has caused no mess. Very clever! She sleeps on my bed at night with my other big cat. Her name came about cos I found her quite late at night in the month of May. Ideally, to go with her lively and playful personality, adopter should already own a kitten or cat to keep her company and to wrestle with and chase around. Adopter who wants to have May must be a good pet owner who provides a loving home environment and healthcare complying to the following pet lover's requirements :- 1) Vaccinations 2) Neutering 3) Lots of TLC! Do text or email me. Thanks for viewing her profile. :D"

No Name,"My friend rescued this kitten from being run down in the middle of the road among the workshop zone last Saturday in Bandar Sunway. Now the kitten is up for adoption as we dont have the capacity to take care of it and we don't really want to send it to a shelter because we know for sure a kitten at that age will not survive the shelter condition. Yet we dont have the space to keep a kitten of this age. We are suspecting the kitten to be a female about 3 weeks old. Obviously no medical record but the kitten appears to look healthy. We have been feeding it dry kitten kibbles soak in milk at home. It's still quite fiece but we suspect its due to the poor eye sight (due to young age). But once you hold the fella and stroke her, she will calm down. Of course situation doesnt really help also since we have another cat that kept hissing at her everytime she meows. We will not be charging if someone is able to provide her a home. Please contact me, Stephani at for details."

He was found in a very bad state, soaking wet, shivering and not walking very well. He is extremely friendly with me but is very nervous with everything else around him but has calmed down a lot over the last few days. I'm not sure what breed he is or how old he is. If i had to guess at an age i'd say roughly 8 weeks after searching on the internet.

CAT 2 (FLUFFY),i have 3 cats cat 1 cat 2 cat 3
Murphy,"A Malay neighbour asked for my help to rehome Murphy and she has be raising him for 2 months after her children rescued him. - He has a long tail and no tail deformity unlike most other domestic cats. - He was dewormed by a vet on 2 September . - He was vaccinated on 2 September at a cost of RM59. - He was Frontline-sprayed on 2 September to protect him against fleas for about a month. - His weight is 1.47 kg as at 2 September . - I'm feeding him with premium dry cat kibbles (Evo - Turkey & Chicken Formula). - He can drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kitten to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage his health and shorten his life. - He's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using premium scoopable cat litter (Ever Clean). - His poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as his overall health. - His behaviour: He's domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. He would purr when being stroked. He would eat treats from my hand. He would follow me around at home and rub against me. He can get along with other cats. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. 2) The adopter must be active on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on the cat and forgo the need for house visits to check on him. 3) The kitten must be kept indoors at all times. 4) Neuter him when he's old enough at 6 months old. 5) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 6) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 7) The RM59 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will just cover the vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. 8) Adopt him at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Murphy, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first."

Cream,"I found Cream at he outside parking area of Limkokwing University Cyberjaya. Never seen him before there. He looks terrified and skinny. But he don't have any physical injury, soft coat and clean ears. He know the command 'sit'. He is a very sweet boy. He wanted to be loved so much. He like to be pet on his head, he placed his hands on my lap, he wrapped his and around my hand, wanted me to hug him, he even touched his nose on my chin while he close his eyes. That place is not suitable for dogs. There's no source of food and water not even shelter, many cars will come in and out everyday. There's a construction site nearby that parking area which makes it even more dangerous. He need a fosterer/adopter as soon as possible."

Bubu has a wound near his mouth (the vet suspected it was from either an insect bite or a kitten fight) and we are currently treating him with antibiotic pills and dressings. All of us have graduated and are heading back to our hometowns. We would like to put Bubu up for adoption and would preferably look for an adopter who is: 1. Willing to treat his wound. (it's healing well and has dried up, just need to finish what is left of his antibiotic) 2. Must send him to his second injection for ear mites. 3. Must vaccine him. 4. Will preferably neuter him when he is of age. Bubu is affectionate (he's the purr-er type), playful, loving and beautiful (look at that fur! Its super soft as well). He has a bob tail which makes him even more special. üíô‚ù§Ô∏è Please help share this around. We really want him to find someone who can love and care for him as much as (or better than) we did. If you are interested, please PM me or drop a comment below so I can reach out to you.

My favourite foods are tuna (yum, yum) and mackerel fish. I can also use my teeny teeth to eat cat biscuits. I love to be petted, hugged and carried around.

Aki, the bigger male, is inquisitive and loves to run around and scale new heights while Fuyu, the female is more elegant but still likes to play with Aki. They were so timid when they were smaller but they've since gained newfound energy. They are very 'manja' and Aki especially loves being pet around the neck and belly. Fuyu is more suttle and slow to warm up to strangers but loves being pet and play with. Fuyu loves Aki a lot and feels lost whenever Aki is not around, she'll cry out for Aki if she doesnt see him."

"Nescafe, Coffee & Horlicks","#already been booked I'm trying to find a new home for this girls asap because I could no longer take care of them. I have few cats already. And the mother had given birth to this kitties. And the other two siblings. I also need to let them go asap because I'm going to neuter the mother. They have started eating but still once in a while having breastfeed from the mommy. That's why I need to let them go. These babies are very active and playful. But a little bit shy. These girls are special because they followed the mother's rosette pattern and colors. They are all alike and that's why I'm posting them as a group. If there is any loving person who could take care of these kitties, please adopt them either all together or by one. Kindly call me asap for adoption. Thank you. :)"

We have been litter box trained (we're total pros at it!). We are clean and healthy, having been Frontlined and dewormed. We both like to play with each other and chase anything that moves, particularly toy balls and feathered teaser sticks. We also love cuddles and kisses, and our fosterer gives us lots of those. We would like to be adopted together and hope our new family will cuddle and kiss us all the time too! It would be the best thing ever if our new family could love and give us a forever home. :) Please contact our fosterer Aida at if you would like to adopt us.

Bambi,Bambi was rescued when she ran into my neighbour's house who has 4 big dogs. She was only 1 month old and very skinny.

I am looking for a serious adopter who can give her a loving home. The adopter must promise to vaccine and spay her at the age of 6 months. First Vaccine will be done before giving to the adopter.

Ling Ling,"Ling Ling (short for Darling) is the most affectionate cat you can have. She sits on your lap in the evenings and place her paw gently on your face, claws retracted (serious!), purring away. Very playful and inquisitive, with big bright eyes and expressive meows whenever you talk to her, Ling Ling makes a great and funny companion. She is easy to pick up as she lets you do it, not like some cats. And she loves the adventure of being underneath the blanket! She also loves climbing into any box you may open. Give her a plastic bag and she'll have a whole night of fun. She's also toilet trained. However, Long Ling is not perfect. She is afraid of strangers at first, but warms up gradually and then becomes affectionate after some time. We have rescued other cats before and she doesn't like them. We think that she might learn to like them if we let those other cats stay longer, but so far we haven't tried. Ling Ling also likes to pull out toilet rolls and tissue paper, so beware!"
Dino,"Dino is a lovely shaggy with a calm and gentle temperament. He has cute reindeer-like ears and a unique-colored coat. Unfortunately he has a very irresponsible owner who neglects him. He was put outside the house from morning, and not given any food or water. Dino was fed by caring neighbors and barked for hours each night before being let into the house again. He is currently at a foster home. Please give this lovely chap a new home. He is very smart and don't bark unnecessarily. Gets along well with other dogs too."

Then I found it laying motionless at a nearby housing area last week, with eye infection, the flu & a bad case of kurap (scabies). Took it in to the vet immediately & currently she is being treated for scabies (kurap, almost healed already) and flu (still ada have a bit of selsema, but should clear up soon, as she's still on some medication). Overall, she's in much better shape now :) Kitten has been dewormed & de-flead & due to be discharged in 1-2 days' time. Her color is a dark tortoiseshell. She is very manja & needy in nature. Always seeking for attention & affection. Maybe because she lacks love..so a lot of love is needed for this baby! Serious adopters needed urgently! Adoption is free. Please contact me if you're interested. I can send her to wherever you are staying. For more pictures of the kitten, go to: Thanks everyone!"

Mummy And Three Kittens,"A stray female had nested in my garden and gave birth to a litter of 3 kittens. I discovered them pretty much the day they were born and have been taking care of all of them indoors. All three kittens are male with distinct personalities developing. They have lovely markings on their coat. They haven't been weaned yet but will be ready for adoption by the 15th of July. I am slowly transitioning them to solid food and mummy cat and I are litter training them. Mummy cat is very affectionate and will love to sit by you and be scratched. She will make a really lovely companion for someone. She has settled in quite comfortably so I foresee she will adapt quite easily. She is quite a young mother, no more than 2 years old. She also seems friendly towards other cats (my two cats are not the friendly type hence she needs to be adopted). My request would be for potential adopters to neuter/spay the kittens (once of suitable age) and mummy cat so that we don't end up with more strays on our streets. EDIT : All three kittens have been reserved. Only mummy cat is available. Please consider adopting her."

She's a vibrant little girl who loves to dash about and play. She is both a little darling as well as mischievous (when no ones looking)! ‚ô• Tequila has her own unique way of displaying affection. Tortoiseshell cats are known for abundance of character and this lady is no different (Read here:). ‚ô• Sometimes she purrs - sometimes she has a lot to say (yes she talks  meows back). Sometimes she forces herself onto our laps for strokes - and at other times she plants a loving nip or two. ‚ô• She gets along great with cats her age and kittens. Is weary of bigger adult cats and only approaches if they're friendly (not growling or hissing). Otherwise she takes some time to adjust. ‚ô• Tequila is great with people although we would recommend that only adults or people adjusted to tortie behavior adopt her (as her nippings might not be tolerable for children). ‚ô• This girl is very clever with her little-box and eats her kibble without complaint. She has been vaccinated, dewormed and given spot-on prevention against fleas and other parasites. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** ‚óã Tequila must be kept INDOORS at all times (for her own safety). ‚óã Tequila must be SPAYED at the right age. ‚óã Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc).

Karma The Kitten,"Hey everyone! So my friends and I were walking around some shop lots earlier this evening and we heard loud meowing coming from a box. To our not-so-surprise, we found a little kitty that some irresponsible nitwit had abandoned infront of phone store. The kitty is being fostered and taken good care of by a friend of mine right now, we are actually really concerned for the little one as she is only 1 week old. And yes, it's a SHE. As for now, she's weak on her limbs since she is only a week old and is without the presence of her mother. She has pretty blue eyes, in fact, that is one of the main features we noticed when we picked her up. ADOPTION IS ONLY FOR RESIDENTS IN THE PETALING JAYA/ KUALA LUMPUR AREA. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DELIVER THE KITTEN TO ANY ADOPTERS, ADOPTION IS BY MEANS OF COLLECTION ONLY. CONDITIONS UPON ADOPTION: 1) The kitten will need to be fully taken care of because of it's dyer need of care at only 2 weeks old. 2) The kitten is to be kept INDOORS at ALL TIMES. (We do not want another case of a homeless kitten.) 3) If you were to adopt this kitten, do expect calls from us from time to time to keep up on her condition as she is still a precious fragile baby that we have been fostering. 4) If Karma cannot adapt to her surroundings, Karma needs to be re-homed as it is only in a kittens nature to find comfort in where they wish to in the absence of the parent cat, and we wished to respect that. 5) Once Karma reaches the age of 1 year, Karma will need to be neutered and vaccinated to avoid further irresponsible abandoning of kittens. 6) We will not allow Karma to be caged, kittens (at least) need to be placed in a comfy kitten litter or a box layered with towels as they are in need of warmth, without warmth, fatality is at hand. 7) Karma is still weak on her limbs, she will require kitten milk, preferably without lactose. 8) Allow Karma to walk for bout 15 minutes a day under supervision to strengthen her limbs.

Requirements for Adoption: ========================= All adoptions are subject to an interview and house check. Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY."
Nondi (Kira),"We found Nondi on a very cold morning after a heavy shower. She was soaking wet and malnourished. We took her in and nursed her, but she was always limping on her right hind leg. From x-ray findings she has a fractured femoral head. She is too young for surgery, but with rest it would heal. She should not jump and run for 2 months. Nondi remains to be a very active kitten, very independant. She is litter tray trained. We are looking for someone to adopt her as we have too many cats. We prefer to give her up to a working Malaysian, no students. We are looking for someone who will vaccinate and neuter her and also take her for regular vet checks. She needs to be kept indoors. For her condition now she should be caged, BUT she hates the cage. So right now she stays in a room but is caged at night. This is only coz we want the fracture to heal. She is very good with our cats and dogs, but mostly she is on her own. Keeping a cat is a commitment for about 15 years and they are children that never grow up and it isn't cheap to keep a pet. Only for serious adopters."

But they wait for me every morning at the gate to greet me without fail and when I am leaving work they see me off. They follow my car for a short distance too.

5 Kittens,5 ekor kittens trpksa lpskn sbb stay flat ramai2 ada yg alegic
Mohawk,"In June,,Mohawk was trapped.Never in his life was he ever confined or looked at 2 feet away by crowd of inquisitive eyes with hostility.Worst still, he was struck on the skull ended up with a medusa shaped wound with raw flesh exposed ( Pic 2 ). Naturally, He was very traumatised. Could we blamed him for behaving aggressively to all near his cage. He was just trying to frighten intruders away to save his own skin. How else ? He is an animal & confined in a cage amidst a crowd of milling people.He was to be euthanized but SAS thought otherwise. It took us 4 months for him to trust us.We named him Mohawk. His colouring is like an Red Indian with a band of white against rich brown diagonally across his neck.His ears are upright.His chest is white & he has white socks too with a bushy tail. Furthermore, he moves as if he is on a hunt. Mohawk is not aggressive at all. Infact, he plays like a child. All our Ketum dogs play like kids. They don't play in any aggressive manners. For a time , he likes to come near & lift the kennel hand's skirt.He loves his name & pricks up his ears whenever called. 2 teenagers lads told their dad he looks like a film star. Indeed, he does & wants him. Mohawk ia a beauty who must have space & one who cares enough to build up a bond with him. When you do , you willbe proud of him for he will give you presence."

Unnamed,"These 2 kittens came into our lives when their mother, a stray cat in our neighbourhood, had nowhere to put them during this rainy season. One day she was in a pot in our garden, and the next we found that she had brought her kittens into our house, and hid them at our gym. They have been 'living' with us since. They are still not quite used to people though. They are still breastfeeding but you can feed them powdered milk, which they can drink from a saucer. Only interested parties should apply for these kittens, preferably those who have had experience caring for young kittens before. Would be good if they are taken together so that they are not all separated."

Kittens & Mother Cat Need Homes,"My friend and I are looking after a mother cat and her babies in our condo. Jewel (mother cat) and her 4 kittens are looking for new homes. Currently, they hang around a safe spot at our condo, Pelangi Damansara, PJ. Our worry is for the safety and fate of these kitties if they continue staying here. We both can't keep them as I already have my own cats and my friend is renting a room. We only managed to take photos of 2 of Jewel's kittens, Jerry and Miko. There are 2 more kittens of similar color. Altogether Jewel has 4 babies. Jewel: Age: Around 2 years old Gender: Female Jewel is an adorable, loving and sweet cat. She's very comfortable around humans, especially those whom she has bonded with. This makes Jewel a great furry companion and a superb house cat. She loves rubbing her head and body against our legs when she's ""manja"". We hope to find a sincere adopter who's willing to adopt an adult cat. Jewel will be a good choice. Jerry and Miko Age: 1 month plus Gender: Jerry (male), Miko (unknown, didn't get a chance to hold it to confirm its gender) Both are Jewel's babies. Playful and cute, Jerry and Miko are looking for forever homes too. Jerry's fur colours are exactly like Jewel's while Miko is pure black. Looking for a true cat lover who's willing to give these babies a good, permanent home. It would be even better if they are adopted together. Kitten 3 and 4: Didn't manage to take photos of Jewel's 2 other babies. Also looking for adopter. Only truly sincere and committed adopters. Please contact me if you are certain that you can give any of these kitties a forever home."

Eaton is now recovering and we are seeking for animal lover to open their heart for Eaton. Eaton is timid due to the way he was treated. Once he gained your trust, he will be your best buddy. We are not charging any adoption fee as all we hope is for the adopter to care and love Eaton. Goodwill donation is welcomed to ease our medical fee burden. To qualify you to own Eaton, here is our requirement : 1) Adopter must be a Malaysian or a PR. If you are below 18 years old, we will require your parents to speak with us on the adoption procedure. 2) Adopter must be an animal lover and preferably have experience in handling dog. 3) No long hour of caging or tied on leash. 4) Provide necessary medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 5) Adopter must add us on Facebook so we can receive her progress update. 6) During the intial stage of adoption, allow visitation so we can ensure Eaton is adjusting well to his new environment. For this reason, adopter residing in Klang Valley is highly preferred. 7) Approval for this adoption is only for the successful adopter. Eaton cannot be transferred to third party without seeking our permission. 8) We reserve all rights to remove Eaton from you if he is found to be neglected under your care.

She has had her first vaccination and deworm pill done. She's also potty trained. A month on she is growing fast! Smart, active and playful, her favourite toys are my Ipad charger (forget Appstore, she has more fun trying to chase it around), a stressball (I feel more destressed seeing her play with it then when I actually squeeze it myself) and a little piece of cloth which I used to cover her when she first came in (I guess it is her security blanket).

Edit: We're also giving a 4kg bag of Royal Canin Babycat, a bag of litter and assorted food things, plus splitting the costs of her eventual spaying. Yes, I am totally bribing people to take her."
No Name,"She is cheeky and healthy. Very clever and tame as well. She was only a week old when we found her along with her 3 siblings and her mum in our neighbourhood. Her mum was in poor health but still tried her best to take good care of her newborns. Being touched by that scene, we decided to help this poor fur family. We tried our best to find adopters. She was the last one left. She was finally adopted by a family who just moved to penang 3 months ago. We were happy as we thought that she has finally found a permanent home. However, we were wrong. Unfortunately, this family was forced to move out from the landed house they rented recently as the house owner has found a potential buyer. This family tried their best to find a new landed house with affordable rental. Again, luck was not with them. They had no choice but to have to move into an apartment. If you would like to give this furkid a permanent loving home, please contact us as soon as possible. Thank you very much."

Parsley,"Update on the 18th of October: Parsley has grow up quite a bit during the last few weeks. He had long fur before, but his fur hasn't grown any longer since; so I need to reclassify him as domestic medium hair now, not domestic long hair. He had marbled speckled green eyes, but they have changed to a green/yellow color, and are less specked. Parsley loves playing with other cats; he likes to play on his own as well. He'll find a comfortable place to sleep when he's tired. Parsley has a good appetite and doesn't meow much--only when he's hungry. I've also de-wormed him today. I fostered Parsley from SPCA. He has a cotton soft coat, speckled eyes, and a short tail. He is the boss when eating; he hits the bowl with his paw and stares at other cats who're sharing food with him. All the cats, including my own, stop when he does that (he doesn't bite or scratch though). What is funny is that he always gets beaten up by other cats when playing. He learns fast: When he meows too much and I shush him he goes quite, then he looks like he's meowing, but with very little sound. That's sweet. Parsley is playful. I'm currently feeding Orijen to Pasley; I feed it to all my cats these days. I used to feed my own cats Royal Canin Hair & Skin, but after I realised it wasn't the best quality food I changed to Origen straight away. I was feeding my rescued cats Acana, but switched to Origen when I found that Acana was often out of stock. I also give cats mineral water/filtered water as I don't like to give them tap water; it's got too many chemicals like chlorine etc. The adopter has to agree to bring Parsley back to me to be neutered around mid January next year. I will pay the neutering fee. Neutering/spaying cats can reduce the number of strays. Many cats get killed everyday by accidents, humans, or dogs. Unneutered males can get many females pregnant during the mating season, so please support neutering/spaying to save lives All the adoption fees will go to trapping and neutering/spaying other strays. The cats I catch will either be returned to nature (TNR), or their photos will be put on PetFinder to be re-homed. A cat's average life is years, but some live up to 20 years if they are well looked after. It is a commitment if you want to have a pet cat. Please DO NOT dump them if they are not cute anymore; they have feelings as well, just like we do. Please give me a ring or sms if you are interested. Thank you. Here is a bit of information about cat food: Cats can't tolerate corn and wheat; they cause cats a lot of health problems. The common brands of cat food--such as Friskies, Smartheart, and Whiskers--contain a lot of these ingredients and are awfully bad for cats. Corn and wheat are just used because they are cheap, but they have no benefit for cats. Well known premium brands, like Royal Canin and Science Plan, also contain corn/maize. I'm unhappy with these companies because their products are pricey, but the quality isn't excellent to match! There are a few other brands that are better quality and don't contain corn and wheat, but at a similar price to Royal Canin and Science Plan: Orijen, Acana, Natural Balance, Evo and Feline Caviar(Holistic) all have 0% corn and wheat and are much better quality."

A friend of mine found them when the mummy cat (top picture) gave birth in his dad's shop but he is allergic to cats and has no means to care of them but the shop lots are not really a safe place for newborn kittens to live. His last resort is to abandon them in a random housing area! I need the help of any kind-hearted man, woman, girl or boy out there who would be kind enough to look after these darlings until they are old enough to be separated from their mum and be given to good homes or if lucky, a home where they can be together.

Smokey,"Little Smokey was found on Thursday morning September , curled up into a tight little ball by the roadside in kampung segambut dalam. He was alone and looked very vulnerable. I was on my way to work when i saw him and stopped to pick him up. I was still near home so i decided to turn around and bring him to my house instead of bringing him to work.. As i drove, he cautiously crept over from his seat and crawled onto my lap where he began purring loudly. he's such a sweet and appreciative little furball!! Smokey loves being cuddled and hugged. He'll come and sit on your lap anytime you're not moving. He's not afraid of other cats or even dogs.. In fact on his first day at my house he initiated friendship with my foster dog Molly. Smokey has a good appetite and playful affectionate demeanor. He is litter trained and loves attention from people. He's on the quiet side but very sociable and loves to explore. Interested parties can sms or email me. A brief introduction of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated. Vaccinations and neutering at 6months are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless kittens like smokey starving and suffering in the streets.. Preferably INDOOR only. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and smokey. - See if potential adopter and smokey are suitable for each other. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get smokey vaccinated before being able to take smokey home. Cost to be borne by adopter."

Ginger,"We were walking in the Georgetown city centre on a Friday night () and came across a poor little ginger kitten. It was malnourished and had a virus so bad that I initially thought it was abused. We offered it food and water but it was too weak to accept it. We knew that it would most likely die of hunger with the state it was in, so we brought it to the veterinary clinic. Since then we have nursed it back to health and brought it back to KL with us. What I have noticed that it is like no other streetcat I've seen before - friendly, cuddly, curious, supercool, overall a lovely character. You may have heard it all before but he is quite a special one! He is now fully recovered from his wounds. We have also dewormed and defleaed him, and his fur is purrfectly beautiful. We are now progressing him with the best vaccination possible. We need to leave the country within the next 2 weeks, so we urgently need to find him wonderful owners who will love him and take care of him. Ginger's hobbies are: football, hunting, extended naps with humans, cuddle big time, getting bellyrubs, and eating!"
No Name,"Their mother seeked refuge under our cover drain. If I'm not mistaken other than the white spotted ones, the rest are female. There are still new born judging by the way they walk.

Very soft fur coat! Very playful! Some videos: Giant and his tennis ball- Giant playing with Snoopy- Giant being bullied- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Due to the overwhelming response from my last email (I got close to emails/ sms/ calls), I am sorry but I need to lay down some ground rules. Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this email and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the terms and conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many emails from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. 1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a pedigree Siberian Husky, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. 2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. 3) Please DO NOT delete my email with all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. 4) This email is dated 2 February . This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. 5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 5 points, please read on: 6) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. 7) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email): - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with: - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before 8) No reservations please. First come first served. 9) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way. 10) If you need clarifications, please call Ryan at."

Robine,"Hi! If you are a Cat Lover & u need a friendly companion then this beautiful cat is up for an adoption. You may wonder why i am giving up this cat for an adoption? It's because it is not technically my cat, it belongs my grandmother whom previously belongs to my aunt but... Unfortunately, they cant afford to own this extremely healthy cat as she weigh as much as her big appetite! Robine now is under my care. I cant keep this cat as i have 2 kittens at home and Robine cant seem to adapt to them well. Plus, i am adopting another kitten from a Vet this week. This worries me, my cat are ok but not Robine. I dont prefer to give this cat away to SPCA, but if i have no other option, i have to let her go. I hope anyone could take this oppurtunity to love and keep her.

Madeleine,"Madeleine was rescued by the kind people of Malaysian Dogs Deserve Better (MDDB) last week. She had been caught by municipal council dog catchers along with a large group of other dogs and puppies and was being held at the MPK (Majlis Perbandaran Klang) Dog Pound. Little Maddie is now staying with my during her rehabilitation. Her time at the pound was quite traumatizing and she had some insecurity issues and fear. She's a sweet, and friendly puppy now, eager to please and learn. She loves the company of people and her new friend Molly Sue. Maddie has been through some very rough times in her young life, i expect adopters to be patient and extra gentle with her. She needs to trust you and feel safe. Maddie doesn't like to be alone so it would be great if she could be adopted by someone with another friendly dog or someone that has time to spend at home. At the moment i am paper-training her because I am not home enough to expect her to be completely housebroken. I think Maddie may grow up to be quite a big dog so adopter should have space for her to run around in and time to take her for walks. vaccinations and spaying are compulsory for adoption. cost of these procedures to be borne by adopter. no caging, no tying up, no beating. adoption procedure for interested parties: - set up a meeting with me and maddie. - see if you and maddie get along. - i'll ask you some questions to make sure you are suitable for each other. - finally, meet up at my vet to pick up maddie and vaccinate her, then you can bring her home. interested parties can sms/call me at or Wani from MDDB at. You may also email me. serious inquiries only please. a brief introduction of yourself and a description of your experience with dogs is appreciated."

I name them Fok, Lu, Shou name after our chinese god, san xing which bring prosperity,status and longevity. I am a cats lover and currently i have 2 adult cats with me. Due to my job where i need to outstation frequently, it's difficult for me to handle a total of 5cats at home.

Blackie is a stray kitten that I've been taking care of (together with mama cat and the rest of the fam) since its birth.

Looking for loving adopter who would welcome Blackie in and give him a comfortable and good home. There is no adoption fee but the adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1. Spay/neuter the cat once it is old enough. 2. Vaccinate the cat yearly. 3. Strongly encouraged to apply spot-on (deflea) medication once in a while to protect the cat (and also yourself) against parasites."
Raffi And Biscuit,"We adopted Raffi and Bisuit around two years ago as part of a litter of unwanted puppies from a mass-SMS cry for help. Unfortunately, after fostering them for a couple of years, we are finding it very difficult to balance our fondness for animals with our allergies. 3 of 4 members of the family have asthma with very high allergy levels and we are having to spend less and less time with them in order to breathe, which is pretty unfair to the dogs. Both are females, siblings, and high intelligent and easy to train. They are also pretty energetic given their bloodline (Golden retriever cross x Lab retriever cross). They have already been trained to be quiet and they will only bark when approached by strangers entering the compound. They are good natured and friendly. Both are spayed. We really do hope we can find a good home for them so they are not as lonely. They have their own decent compound throughout the day plus time to romp around at least twice a day."

Mui's Litter Of 5 [4/5 ],"A pregnant cat we call Mui (after Anita Mui, since she has a hoarse voice) came to us on Deepavali eve, and we've been taking care of her ever since, from pregnancy, to birth, to the now 6 weeks old furry cuties who are ready to find their forever homes :) Adoption of 2 or more of them is highly encouraged! [names are all temporary, for convenience] Curly [Male Ginger] Has a curly tail, cute white toe socks and a playful and curious personality. Sort of the 'Big Brother' of the litter, a little bigger than the rest and a outgoing personality to match! Chinaman [Male Ginger] Has unique eyes, and a comparably calmer demeanor compared to Curly, Tiger and Tortoiseshell, but still plays very well with all siblings at playtime 3. Trinity [Female tricolour of white, orange, black] Very playful and energetic, she is the one to initiate play all the time and runs around the most compared to her sibs. Also very fastidious in her cleaning, as I see her clean herself longer than the others do. She has a soft, very prettily coloured coat and white stockings Big Eyes [Female gray tabby] She has a comparatively gentler temperament, and is more on the reserved side like Chinaman, and both like to sit and stare quietly at times, but when it's playtime she runs about with the rest. She has softer fur than the others, and may turn out to have medium rather than short length fur. Tiger [Female gray-brown tabby] The runt of the litter, she is lively, energetic and can be very vocal to compensate for her small size. She keeps up just fine with everyone, and has a rather unique shade of coating, a gray orange hue. Please message for any inquiries, more pictures or videos, I would be very happy to oblige, cheers!"

He approaches me every time I walk to work and always wants to be petted (he meows at me and follows me). He really needs a home but unfortunately I already have 7 cats and cannot take in any more. If anyone is willing to adopt this little furball, I can get him cleaned and treated at the vet and bring him to you (as long as you live in Kuala Lumpur).

Kitty,"The playground at the back of my parent‚Äôs place is a dumping ground for unwanted kittens. Normally; they are old enough to fend for themselves and they eventually leave the place. However, this lone kitten was around a month old or less when we saw him & was bawling away for 6 nights in a row, calling for his mother, finally on the 7th night, there was a thunderstorm & it bawled even louder, so we decided to bring the shivering kitten home to drier place. If anyone out there who is looking for an active & talkative kitten, this is the kitten for you. He is very attached to humans as he sits by the gate & watches us whole day long when he is not busy playing with dried leaves. Kindly contact Yee at if you are interested."

Brownie,"One of 5 pups born in our neighbour's unoccupied home on 21st-August-. With 2 male dogs together with the existing female (possibly a Collie), this is the unevitable result of nature taking its course. It's Season 2 (For those who remembered Maley & Bigfoot who found an owner here) There were actually 5 pups but one got drowned during a heavy downpour in the wee hours of the night. Have so far conducted 2 successful rescue missions late in the night during heavy rain by jumping over the wall & searching for them with a flashlight & placing them in higher grounds. Well, it's all worth it in the name of love. The litter this time round is a mix bag of colours unlike the white ones for Season 1. Nicknamed Brownie, she is mostly brown with some very even tones of cream. Even got a brown nose to go with the face. For those who like cookies, would you like to have a brownie instead? (Not for EATING though but for loving) Attached with this profile, you can find the pics of the Mom & Dad. We suspect the father to this little cutie to be Dad 1."

Gertrude And Cake,"Two months ago, I found three abandoned kittens in a small box on the side of the road. They were only a month old and were quite helpless. I had to buy formula and we bottle fed them. One of them was adopted by my friend but I don‚Äôt know anyone else personally who can take the other two. Now, two months on, they are very playful, active, and extremely friendly. They love human company and will purr when you pick them up. I can‚Äôt keep them because my cat isn‚Äôt used to other cats and gets stressed out by them. I insist that whoever adopts them will spay them when the time comes and gets all the proper vaccinations and deworms them regularly. If possible, I would also like the adopter to take both. If not, it would be good if the adopter already has another cat that is friendly as I feel they may get lonely without other cats for company since they‚Äôre not used to it.Gertrude has a small white patch on her forehead while Cake has a completely black forehead. They do not recognize their names so the adopter can choose new names."

Whiteface & Callie,"Whiteface and Callie were born to Mama Kin who came to me heavily pregnant and insistent I let her in to have her babies in my home. They have 3 other siblings, all of which have been adopted. Whiteface is a voracious eater, is the most talkative in the group and LOVES to cuddle. His purring will remind you of speedboats :) Callie is the only female in the litter and is a true lady. She does the rough rumble and tumble occasionally but most often than not, she would be snuggling up to momma cat or me while the boys run riot. She loves scritches under the chin and belly rubs. They want to go to a home where they will be loved and cared for. Also, I will pay for neutering/spaying and vaccination if needed be (they have had two out of three vaccination shots). Only serious adopters please. TQ!"
Boots,"Boots, the formal wear kitty, was left abandoned outside my apartment block at about 3-weeks old. He was bottle-fed and socialised with human adults and children. Therefore, he gets along well with people including young children. He is a perfect kitten - healthy, playful, friendly and eats with a big appetite. He enjoys hanging out with humans and seems to like smelly feet. He is, therefore often very close to your legs, so the adopter must be always careful to check where he is before stepping! Boots purrs loudly, but has a surprisingly soft and gentle meow even when he is yowling for his nom noms. Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-flea and de-worm treatment was done on 18 June. * Vaccination has to be given when he gets bigger - when he reaches about 2-3 months old. * The adopter has to make sure that he gets quality fresh food so that his tuxedo coat looks like its made of satin and silk all the time. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure he gets a good chance at a long healthy life. Please email or sms me if you are interested to adopt. Give your name, where you live and work and the reason why you want to adopt. I would inquire some details from you to understand your request for a pet."

Maddie,"Looking for a playful, caring and affectionate kitten? Maddie the Nomad is approximately 9 months old. Two months ago she was rescued from the streets, as she was malnourished, suffering from cat flu and heavily pregnant. The tablets prescribed by the vet to treat her caused a miscarriage but perhaps that was the universe saying she was too small to give birth. Since then she has been treated for cat flu and has been spayed. She has also had her vaccinations and been dewormed. We believe that she was someone's pet until she became pregnant as she has no fear of humans and is litter trained. She is very friendly, loving and adores cuddles and playing with her toys. She is not good with dogs. Adoption is free. If anyone is looking for a loving new family member and is willing to give Maddie a forever home, just promise to love her and play with her every day."

Cappuchino,"Cappuchino was found wandering aimless on the street like a lost dog. He caught my attention when all my dogs were barking ferociously at him. He was in a rugged condition - flea, lice and tick infested, very thin, but cheerful still. I couldn't bear the thought of leaving him straying on the street helplessly. His mommy or siblings were no where. So I brought him to the vet, dewormed, deflead, deticked, vaccinated. I even shaved all his hair to allow new beautiful hair to start growing. He's a handsome healthy happy chap now. Cappuchino is a very smart alert dog, he doesn't bark incessantly. He only barks when he needed to pooh or pee. He learned how to ""sit"" on command in just a few minutes. He's very adorable, cheerful, happy-go-lucky, well-disciplined, mixes well with all other dogs of all sizes. I already have 3 big dogs in my small house, I can no longer afford to foster him. Please find a home for this adorable chap."

Scruffy,"Scruffy is looking for a good home/family who will spend lots of time with her, take her for long walks and most importantly give her lots of love... ************************************************** This is Scruffy's story: About a month ago, I was at my usual coffee shop in Hulu Kelang this morning, when I saw this tiny puppy wandering round the shop. She was really frail and quite dirty with a skin condition, and was looking for a kind person to cuddle up to and not so much for food. But of course Malaysians being Malaysians, most of them shoo-ed her away and some even kicked her. The coffee shop owner then informed me that her mother had recently been killed - someone had poisoned her. As I usually have a small amount of dog food with me in the car, I gave her some. She ate a little but just wanted to be petted. She then went to another table curled up at the feet of this old man. Thankfully this man did not kick her. I asked several people if they would take her, but of course none would. In the end, I asked the shop owner for a box and brought her home. I just could not bring myself to leave her there. I took her to the vet and it was confirmed that she had a severe case of sarcoptic mange. She was treated with Ivermectin for 5 weeks and she is now a healthy, active puppy. We're not entirely sure what breed she is, but she looks like she could have some Jack Russell in her and possibly some Dalmation as well as she has quite a lot of spots... She has just received her first vaccination and will be completing the remaining 2 shots soon. She has a very good temperament and is good with other dogs. She is curious about our cat and has shown no signs of aggression towards it. She is very playful and is a fast learner.

Our adopted pet started showing signs of being pregnant and gave birth to four heart-achingly cute and healthy puppies on 5th August. Keeping 5 pets at home is quite a task for us, so we are hoping if you are really keen on committing into caring for a pet, do give him or his 2 other brothers a thought. We shall have him and his brothers with us for about 2 more months as they are still nursing on their mother. We shall deworm and give him 1st vaccination when he reached 2 months old. Thereafter, he will be ready to be adopted."

He's a gorgeous little sable Pomeranian and knows a few commands such as sit and stay. He loves being pet and sleeping on your lap all day long. Of course, he's been an indoor only dog so far and does not have issues with using his pee-pad. He has been socialised with cats and has no issues getting along with dogs bigger than himself.

My future wife doesn't like cat. I really hope that they will get a new owner who'll love them just like I do. They can't be separated as they love each other.

Miko's cheerful and trusting nature deserves a truly good home, where he knows he will be safe for the rest of his life. p.s. I share a special feeling towards this baby because he is such a sweet and obedient boy! If you are able to give Miko that loving home, please contact: "

Pupssssss NEED LOVE,"Dearest future adopters, I'm Diyanah, im helping a friend to find lovely homes for 9 little gorgeous orphan pups who were delivered by their stray mother in front of my friend's house in Damansara Utama. The pups are super adorable, they are approximately 3 weeks old. They are mixed breed of mongrel and bull dog. 8 of them are in black except for 1 which is in light soft golden brown. Not sure of their gender as they are too small to be determined :P . We are desperately looking for adopters as these pups deserve to be loved and to be cared for. As for now, they are still in front of my friend's house under a shade she made to cover them from the hot sun rays and the cold rain. My friend cant take them in as she has one hugeee cranky dog who lives in the house and i cant even if reallllyyy want to :( . Therefore, adopters please consider on taking in these pups as they are ready to lit your heart with so much loveeee and warmth.. promise!!!!"
Bobby,"Yes,I was nasty.I was a handsome lad. Suddenly catchers came & They pulled me so hard that my left elbow was dislocated. I moaned & moaned at the pound.My moan must have been haunting; so haunting that I was taken out with 90 others on the 4th of May,. I was angry & so frustrated that I will attack good lookers. Obviously, i was made to do times; just times nothing else.I begin to realize why now & is much calmer now.And you know what,they let us, me & the good Lookers,out separately. Gradually, we all realized how stupid we were.And we are out at all times now."

Chubby Kittens Need Caring Home.,"Any one ready to adopt? All three different colour. one is white with brown and yellow patches, one is silky brown and one is black with white paws. One is adventurous, one is sentimental and the small one has a good appetite. They are on kitten milk. All healthy and lively."
Opus,"Opus (his temporary foster name) was found in my backlane and believed to be abandoned because he was new to the neighbourhood, bullied by established community cats and did not know how to look for food. Thus, I rescued and nursed him back to good health. His overly-friendly behaviour and insistence to stay indoors confirms my suspicion that he was previously an owned cat rather than a stray. Thus, it was best for him to be rehomed rather than released back outdoors where he won't survive. About Opus: - applied MONTHLY with Advocate (latest on 19 September ) to protect against fleas and heartworms. - His weight is 4.6kg as at 26 September . - NEUTERED on 29 June . - VACCINATED on 8 July . - MICROCHIPPED on 15 August . - Tested NEGATIVE for FeLV&FIV on 18 August . - Full blood test on 18 August which showed GOOD kidney and liver health. - fed with PREMIUM cat kibbles (Monge - 33% protein content). - drinks water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled daily for his good health. - TOILET-TRAINED to use the litter box. His poo is solid and well-formed which is an indicator of good health & good bowel movement. - domesticated, overly friendly, very AFFECTIONATE and constantly seeking attention. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The cat must be kept indoors at all times. 2) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 3) Apply spot-on medication (Advocate recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 4) The adoption fee of RM90 must be paid in full as it only partially covers the cost (total: RM!) of his neutering (RM60), microchipping (RM), FeLV&FIV test (RM) full blood test (RM) and vaccination (RM53). Your adoption fee will go to helping the next needy furkid. If you're interested to adopt Opus, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience."

PATCHES,"Patches is a a gregarious girl who loves attention and to be patted. She is very alert and would be the kind of dog which will do well in a family with children.

Jill,"Jill was found the night after the flood that devastated Penang. Found crying and alone at a bottom at a hill slope at midnight. I went out to look for her in after hearing her constant cries for an hour. No mother dog was around. We suspect she could have rolled down from somewhere at the top of the slope. She was no more than 2 weeks old at the time. She is now a strong and active puppy. She is very lively, friendly and is playful. Eats very well. Due to personal constraints, I was unable to foster her. Therefore, she was placed under a paid fosterer and is now still being cared for by the paid fosterer. I am willing to drive her to Ipoh or KL if you are outside Penang and is interested in adopting her."

No adoption fees, just hoping that the adopter can provide them with proper love and attention that they deserve. My location is in Taman Melawati, KL.

Dubu,Eats IAMS chicken and likes shashimi treats. A bit unsecure cat but if it recognize it would be the most pampered cat.
Max,"I gave him the name ""Max"" because I wish he can live his life to the Maximum. Reason being is when I found him at Putrajaya March this year, he was attacked by a disease called ""Panleukopenia"", my vet told me there is no medicine for that but strongly depends on his own immune system. To have a strong immune system my vet adviced me to buy the antibiotic and vitamin C at pharmacy. Thank God the Great One, Max is fully recovered now and waiting for great owner to adopt him. He is a very good cat because he is very well in his behaviour and manner. When I say ""no cannot go kitchen"" he will turn back to his original place and lay down. I am waiting for another 2 vaccination to be completed. One in end Oct and another end Nov, therefore Max is available in beginning Dec. Please give Max a chance to have a nice home to live because I found him really worth your love and attention! :)"

Coco (The Labrador Mix),"Many thanks to Miss Jasmine from Penang to adopt COCO and promising to give her a new sweet home! I picked up Coco from SPCA 2 weeks after I got another dog Fifi. I'm not very familiar with type of breed as I'm no expert, but according to the SPCA guys, she is a Labrador mix. 5 months, she grew rapidly. She's a bit heavier compared to my other dog and she has strong thigh. She's a loving puppy and most of the times will be playing on her own. She is toilet trained, poo only outside the house and pee only in toilet. She loves to ride in car with air blowing to her face. Coco feds only on Purina Dried Food and canned food on weekends. Unfortunately, Coco is now alone at home as Fifi has been adopted by a new good owner with someone to accompany her all the time. I hope to find a good owner for Coco as well as I love both of them. Reason for me to let go is due to my career which requires me to travel very often now. I have no choice but to let her go with a heavy heart. You can write to me to Nicholas. or sms me at (I‚Äôm in meeting most of the time and wont be answering) or BB Pin 21BEE."

I was so afraid at that time and all I could think is to cross the road.I want to search for my mum. She picked me up and hold me gently. I remembered feeling so comfortable and safe. She said to me that it was so dangerous to cross a road plus it was green light turn. I didn't know what green light is but likes the way she treated me. She and her friend took me home and gave me a good bath. Since then I have a place to call home and feel so happy .I have a playmate and her name is Debby. I love to play with Debby.

Putih,"Actually I found this cat (I called putih) wondering at 20th lvl flat near my home this month, feb ,hungry and kept meowing, I took him home and try to search for his owner, write an ad and stick near elevator for 3 to 4 days but nobody come and claim him.I decided to find him a new owner, because I cannot adopt him,this is because, my husband,not allowed me and furthermore I already have one male cat and both of them didn't get along until now, I don't know how to make putih friend with my cat, Kiko(also a male cat), putih will cried frantically if he see Kiko is near his cage.I put putih outside in cage and kiko of course inside my home. I want to protect both from injure and harm and decided to find a good owner for putih, a good and wide area for putih not in cage, He is a sweet cat and charming,toilet train (he ""pub"" using toilet litter sand, He NO spray or NO urinate everywhere), he just feel unsecure with Kiko near him and outside, in evening is hot so, i don't want putih to suffer being cage all the way in his life. So hoping somebody kind and good, care to adopt him.For your info, I sometime let putih out from cage and locked Kiko in one of my room, cause Putih seem like unsecure and ready to attack Kiko if he see Kiko and of cause Kiko will try to protect himself. I cannot keep up with this anymore because I need to search for a job myself,my life and my husband,cause i am not employed for a moment, and will have to search for work soon,so I really need to settle ""Putih"" problem as soon as possible. p/s:(already adopted by welee lee. My pray and love always be with you putih.)"

May,"Due to moving to a new residential that doesn't allow pets, we're unable to keep May as a part of our family. We will truly miss her and hope that someone can give her a new loving home. May is friendly and loving, but also a very good guard dog. She doesn't bite or is destructive to things - even our shoes and slippers were completely untouched! May is pretty obedient, when we need her to head into her cage she does it obediently on command. We used to give her car rides often too, so she loves it and doesn't panic while in it. Another lovable trait is that she almost behaves like a cat! She loves to keep her body close on an owner's leg, often sitting down or taking naps next to the closest human being. We hope someone will give her a home as we don't want to send her to adoption shelters. :("

No Name,"Female Pregnant cat looking for a carer/home. This pretty girl cat suddenly appeared at my house, and I have been feeding her for a few months, (other than feeding another black kitty). Her tummy seems to be growing bigger and i felt it last night and am thinking she is pregnant already, which is why i am anxious to get her adopted/taken away from this area as last night i witnessed my neighbour trying to kick and throw things at her. *sad* On top of that, I am is also migrating in August, so poor kitty would have no feeder after that. She is very friendly to humans and other cats, but has weak hind legs (either deformed from birth or due to a beating). She currently sleeps in their porch under my car most days, and I feed her twice a day.

Max ( Please Read Profile ),"Max was bought when he was just a puppy and was bred as a champion pure breed . He's a very active dog and can get very ""manja"" . It is best to have just him instead of having other dogs in the house as his spitz lineage and gender makes him very instinctively dominant . He's groomed regularly at the salon and is a well loved pet . Reason for being put up for adoption : I will be leaving the country soon and do not want to subject him to fly with me as Australia has very strict rules about pets , therefore it will be a long and stressful process for Max to relocate with me . // Interested parties please drop me a whatsapp with a short profile of you , your location and your history with pets . Thank you ."

No Name,"We found a litter of 6 kittens lost nearby our home and rescued them but we cannot afford to take care of them so we're hoping to find them homes as soon as possible. Four of the kittens are very healthy and playful. The other two however are smaller in size and are weaker compared to the other four. One has discharge in its eyes (which we have been constantly cleaning every time the eyes start to form the discharge) and the other is the smallest and weakest among all the kittens, is blind on its left eye and has a tough time consuming any food. I won't be in Malaysia around the mid of next month, as I am going overseas to further my studies, so I hope someone could accommodate at least one; or if possible, the whole lot. UPDATE: We've sent them to the vet for a basic check up and they happen to have caught a mild flu. But the doctor gave us some antibiotics and eye drops (for the one with discharge). They are also dewormed and the vet did a random heart worm check on one of the kittens and it came back negative. So they are basically getting better in health now and as of today, they look better and are more active."

I was there about another 2 weeks, they kept me because I am an expensive breed, but they don't know me, they don't understand how my breed's behaviour,they let me stay at car porch with hardly any roof, I been tied up... that's why I got tick fever from lack of care.. then once again I got abandoned. My new foster took me home, my eyes hardly see anything and almost blind because of the tick fever. I went to doctor, and my eyes is getting better now. My new fosterer gave me heart guard and apply front line on me. I am always horny that's why I can't get along with my new foster female dog.

I wish I can find someone who willing to give me a good home, I don't like been tied up or staying in cage any more, I need patient people to train me, I am willing to learn. I want to be spay because I hate breeder to use me as a money making machine. Please bring me home, I can bring a lot of joys to you and your family. Please contact my foster and take a look at me.

Tallulah Mama,"My people kept many of us. We were all semi long haired. I loved them because they were kind and fed us well. The small ones would sometimes make us toys from rolled up news paper and bits of string. They also let us out of the cage we lived in and I enjoyed running and chasing, climbing and rolling around on the floor. One day I had babies. My people looked at me a lot and whispered furtively. I did not understand what they were saying but I was too busy caring for my babies. One morning, almost a week after having my babies, we were all packed into a box. After some strange jostling and swaying, the box plummeted to the ground and there was silence. I began to feel afraid and began to wonder what to do while nursing my babies. When the boxed was next opened, I heard a girl‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúAiyo! Not again. Mummy cat and five kittens.‚Äù She picked us up and check us over. I was worried when she inspected the kittens but she seemed gentle if unimpressed. I was insulted as my kittens were the loveliest in the world, in my opinion that is. ‚ÄúPity they are all short haired‚Äù said the girl. ‚ÄúThe mummy has semi long hair, quite pretty.‚Äù I was placed in a room with glass walls. This I found most disconcerting as I was accustomed to bars and steel. I could see many other cats. They were curious and came very close. This made me very worried; would they try to harm my babies? Would they steal the food I needed to keep making milk for my babies? I missed my people. I missed the children who would play with me. I missed my cat friends too. A few days later, the girl, Olivia she was called, gingerly showed me a few more babies. My heart swelled. they were dirty and weak. Two black boys and a little calico girl. Where was their mummy, I wondered? I immediately cleaned them with my tongue and tried to feed them. With 8 kittens to take care of, I was too tired to worry or miss my old home. In fact, I was so tired, I barely had the energy to eat. ‚ÄúShe is falling ill.‚Äù ‚ÄúCrap, what about the kittens?‚Äù ‚ÄúNot yet. But they will.‚Äù I heard them talking about us and making arrangements to take us to the vet. I hated being separated from my babies and foster babies. We were such a big group we had to be placed into two separate carriers. The journey in the car reminded me of my last car trip. Alicia drove us and she sent Reiki. I knew we were going to get help so I reserved my energy. ‚ÄúHer name is Tallulah, a Gealic name meaning ‚Äòfruitful woman‚Äô because she takes care of so many ‚Äù I heard Alicia say to the nurse. Over the next ten days, we were pilled, dropped and force fed. Olivia and Weng fought hard to help us regain our health. Two of my foster babies died but gradually we got better. ‚ÄúShit! Two more in a box‚Äù said Olivia. ‚ÄúTallulah Mama is too weak. We must hand raise‚Äù decided Alicia. Dr Bel agreed. But I was getting better and they crying kittens hurt my heart. When Olivia had them at the shop, I did my best to show her I wanted to help. I would pace my room and speak to her. She began to let the kittens spend the days with me but she took them home at night. I missed them and worried if they would be warm enough and if they would get enough milk. In the mean time, my babies recovered and began to play. A few days ago, Dr Bel decided I was completely better so Olivia let the two new babies live with me. I am taking care of them but they are very naughty. They climb and jump like monkeys and my own babies think they are ill mannered because they did not have a good mummy like they did. I will keep trying to instill good manners and proper feline dignity in my two new babies though I think it will be a tough journey. ‚ÄúAIKS!‚Äù I heard Olivia shout again today. I know something has happened. She usually sleeps, smiles and is slow and gentle. Now she is groaning and calling Alicia. She is very animated and distressed. I look out of my room and can see a box. I can hear more babies crying. I look at my extended brood of 8 and sigh. Can I do more? The answer is, ‚ÄúI must try.‚Äù"
FREE VACCINE √∞¬ü¬å¬ü 2 Kittens,"This rescued mother cat gave birth to 5 kittens on Sep 12. Balance 2 female are ready to be adopted now. If you decide to adopt, please neuter the kitten when it is about 4-mth old. We need to control the reproduction and over population of strays in the country. On Petfinder here alone, already there are more than 5k cats and 7k dogs without owners, not counting those still outside on the streets. Their lives are miserable. We should not add to these numbers and multiply the numbers unnecessarily, adopt more if you can."
May & Flower,"I rescue this kitten while they was left in front of my door around 1 weeks old, please give them a warm house"
Blancharte,"Poor cat was abandoned; she in one cage, her batch of kitties in another cage. All of the kittens died but she survived. Rani has rescued her and got her neutered. She is a very lovely light grey cat, gentle and friendly as she has been domesticated before. Blancharte needs an owner who will provide her a good, loving home after all she has been through. Persons wishing to adopt her must commit to looking after her welfare throughout her lifespan. She has been discarded cold-heartedly and she has lost all her babies due to the inconsiderate action of her previous owner. Please get in touch with Rani if you wish to have this lovely cat in your home."

4 Healthy Playful Puppies Available,"Our rescued dog gave birth to six beautiful puppies in late October (), and though she refused to care for them, we fell in love with them immediately. They've all been very well cared for - we give them all the proper nutrition, exercise and plenty of attention. They come from good stock - dad is a lab/mix, and mother is a mongrel (rescued when she was a few weeks old). The mother is a very good guard dog, so we're hoping her pups will have inherited her instincts. We've given two puppies away, and so four remain. We can't keep them all, so we're looking for easy-going and kind homes for these little bundles of joy. We've got three males and a female - all very well behaved (well, about as well behaved as puppies can be!). One is off-white, the three others are varying shades of golden brown (see pics). Please let us know if you or anyone you know may be interested."

No Name,"Hi, I rescued this kitten from a drain today and I am urgently looking for someone kind to adopt him. I am allergic to cats and I am a living in a condo , so I am not allowed to keep him for too long. He is domestic medium/long-haired + blue eyes + light yellow at the ears and tail. He can eat solid food on his own. If no one is able to adopt him, I have no choice but to release him where I found him. There is not much food here and there are a lot of cars so it is not safe for a kitten. Really hope someone can give a loving home to this adorable kitten. Please pm/whatsapp me if anyone is willing to adopt him. Thank you!:) Bukit Jalil. ( transportation can be arranged depending on location)"

Super Girl,Hi everyone This is super girl. She is a very active 3 legged girl who loves to run and play. Well she had an owner before but she was abandoned because to their eyes she is not perfect anymore. An injury caused a broken hind leg and because it was not treated properly it became a permenant problem and cannot be fixed. She now stays at the vet because the owner didnt come back to take her. I wish someone could give her a home.
