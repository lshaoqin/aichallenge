"big moo aka lembu, moonster, gizmo","hi everyone! my foster mummy's friend found me in a storm drain with my brother and sister when we were less than 2 weeks old. it was raining and we cried for our cat mother but she didn't come. so, mummy's friend climbed into the drain and rescued us. unfortunately she didn't know how to care for such young kitten so she passed us onto our foster mummy.. we were weak and sickly but mummy tried to keep us alive with bottles of kitten formula and visits to the met. sadly, my brother and sister died after two weeks when they caught terrible sinuses. i'm the only survivor. now, i'm strong and old enough to be adopted by someone kind, loving, and responsible. i'm hand-reared so that means i will be a great companion. i'm not afraid of people because they are all i know. sometimes i think i'm human too. because i'm hand-reared, i lack some of the skill that other cats have. for example, i do not know how to groom myself properly, the person who adopt me must bathe me and brush my hair every week. i also lack survival skill and i'm not familiar with any of the dangers outside so i must be an indoor cat. my foster mummy could not teach me any normal cat behavior but i am totally litter-box trained. it would be great if the adopted has another cat, a very patient one, that i can learn from and play with. here are some details about me: current diet: royal cabin babycat 34 deformed: once, two weeks ago, to be repeated again soon. litterbox trained: i use the litterbox all the time. vaccination and entering are compulsory for adoption. adopted must pay for the vaccination and entering. i am an indoor cat. no cage confinement. adopted must update my foster mummy on my progress and allow a home visit.",46

sandra,"on the 2/1/, while i was parking my car for work i stumble a female mongrel dog together with 6 supplies lying on a deserted house opposite sprang airport. the house has been demolished half way and all the brick and wire was left there. the female dog was very thin and her bone was visible, the supplies (apron 2 -3 months old) looks healthy to me. i decided to feed them liable daily. the mother dog was very cautious with me she will wait until i put the liable on the ground and move away only then she will eat the liable and she never came close to me. the next day when i was on my way to feed the dogs i saw 1 more supplies is playing together with the rest of the 6 supplies that makes a total of 7 supplies. and the puppy was injured on her left leg, most probably she hurt herself while playing under the bricks and wire. today 6/1/ was very lucky for me, i was able to catch the injured puppy and bring it over to the met. dr sam told me that the puppy may have fallen or accidently cut on a sharp object while playing. it was lucky the wound been treated earlier if the wound is left untreated maggot will appear. dr sam have deformed and clean up the wound and bandage it and told me to bring the puppy over to the clinic on this coming friday 8/1/ for some minor operation. the minor operation is to remove some excessive flesh and to stick up the wound so that it will recover more faster. but the real good news is the puppy was tested negative for distemper and part virus. overall the puppy was in great health. the puppy is whining and sometime a bit of howling as if to me it was calling for its mother and her sitting. temporary i will be fostering this puppy until it recover and hopefully there is someone is willing to adopt her, as i'm staying in an apartment and i'm having my own dog with me, i'm worry my neighbour will start to complain. there are 6 more supplies plus the mother dog waiting for adoption.",33

"miu ciu, small black, orengy & teleng","mid in, small black, helene & openly are about 4 months old today. they were born on th dec . they will be up for adoption. my heart breaks to release them all. since they were two months old, i slept with them every day until now. they are very close to me. even i cried during writing this information. :'( but i cannot keep them all because i already have 11 cats for now. due to limited space, this 4 baby is open for adoption. these cut baby should be an indoor cat only (i never let any of my cat out before, so they have not been expose to outdoor). very sad to let them go actually~ currently they are on royal cabin for kitten. let me tell you a little story about them. mid in, the youngest. very naughty but spoiled. have a short tail. the color is rather unique, where there are white, orange and cream colors. oh yes, he likes to ""me"" a lot. small black, the third born kitten. look elegant and magnificent, probably because of its color. he is black and his hair is rather soft. his chest are white and also white-legged like wearing a socks. his eyes are always round as in ready for ""attacking"" mode. openly, second born kitten. a little careless and playful. his eyes were squatting. long tail, orange cabby and white. the face looks confused, but also love to play. lastly, helene. the first born kitten, getting severe fly when he was two months old, caused him a fever reaching 42 degrees celsus and even seizures. now he's fully healed, but his head slightly tilted due to the fever. that's why he looks pretty cut with his shortcomings. just like his brother, helene is black and white-legged. anyone interested can contact me for pre-booking. this will also provide you some time to do the preparation before this two cut kitten come to your lovely home. i only prefer cat lover, if possible want them to be adopted as pair. because i love to see them both together and they are very attached to each other.",61

awesome,"he puts up a front and acts mean in front of strangers but in actual fact, is a movable and well-meaning dog. it all depends on how you approach him. he generally tends to bark at anyone that passes by the house (or if there's a cat or a noisy vehicle) but it's only because he's protective of the masters of the house. he's a well-groomed and active dog that needs a lot of exercise in the morning before you leave the house. if not, he has a nasty habit of chewing anything in sight. if you do intend to adopt him, i think it would be best to channel has energies by unrolling him in agility courses or even guard/watch dog training. he likes to play fetch with a ball and i like setting him loose leash in a safe open space to play and run around with him. he knows the basic commands but is not always obedient and tends to get distracted. though when it comes to meal times, he will always obey! he needs a firm, stable, cool-headed and knowledgable ""pack leader"" that will give him the ed (exercise, discipline, affection) that i currently can't afford to give him. if you think you fit the description, please give me call to set up a viewing appointment!",28

bobby the smiling shih tzu,"how he was found: bobby was abandoned and was roaming around our neighbourhood one rainy afternoon - all the kiss were mad happy upon his arrival. people played with him, but, as night came and heavy rain poured in, all the doors were shut and nobody let the dog in. he was begging for shelter from house to house. bobby's conditions (health, behaviour, friendliness & etc.): bobby is a friendly dog who enjoys being petted and brushed. he is also very playful and he requires being taken out for a walk everyday. when we first found him, his health was at a very bad stake. he smelled bad and his fur all matted. he had sensitive stomach - he suffered from diarrhoea during the first week and couldn't digest nibbled. we fed him boiled chicken/liver and very soft rice for a fortnight and now he can eat anything (healthy for a dog). i trimmed his fur the first week and brush him on a daily basis. now he looks as charming as the ones at a dog show. we noted several behaviour problems caused by the previous owner. in other words, bobby's owner had abused him and kicked him out of the house. several issues were observed, e.g. bobby is shit scared of broom stick and he shows aggression as we wear slippers in front of him (was beaten by the previous owner with broom stick/kicked with shoes on). he doesn't trust strangers (especially adults); but with patience and obedience training and a lot of treats (what we did), now he jumps around us shaking his tail happily all the time. why we couldn't let him stay we are a cat-lover family and we currently have 2 cats at our household (more are coming). as much as i love bobby and try to help him, my cats show strong objections and disagreements against having a dog in our house. in the end of the day, i believe bobby deserves a better/more experienced dog owner. terms and conditions: there is no adoption fee and no money involved. you could take him to your home as long as you agree to/that - 1. take him out for (at least) a walk everyday 2. brush him on a daily basis, otherwise bobby would have a matted fur 3. strictly no punishment in any form. you can correct him if he does anything wrong, but - you have to understand that he was abused by his previous owner and doesn't trust human a bit, therefore he regards punishment, aggression and violence differently - so, no punishment. what we do is that when he does something right, we give him treats and praise him (a little bit of drama and exaggeration involved); when he does something that we don't like, we show him that we don't like it and ignore him for a while. he wants to please you, so he will do anything if it makes you happy and avoid letting you down. for more details, kindly give me a call at during daytime.",60

the manja mr crankypants,"mr crankypants is one of the cats in a fera colony that my neighbor and i care for. unlike the others, he has become extremely tame and affectionate. while this is nice for us caretakers, it has made our sweet boy vulnerable to abuse. we suspect he has been intentionally harmed at least twice. once he suffered a terrible wound on his chest that looked like he had been scolded with boiling water. more recently he became very ill and we think he was poisoned. our neighbors have been complaining about the stray cats because they are pampered loses with nothing better to do with their lives. in light of these things against our little cranks, it is with heavy hearts that we have decided to put him up for adoption. we love him but we are both full with our own pet cats and foster animals at the moment. i cannot afford to give him the quality of life that he so deserves and the attention that he graves. i think mr crankypants would get along best as an only cat, or with a stayed female cat. i say this because he does not get along with the other male cats in the fera colony but he is just fine with the females. what's special about cranks? sure, he looks like an ordinary grey cabby but his personality is one in a million. he is the sweetest, most affectionate, and attention-seeking cat i have ever met and believe me i've met a lot of cats! he loves giving muddles as much as he loves receiving them. when he has bonded to someone, he can't get enough of their love and he is never finished affectionately putting his head on you and expressing his gratitude. this cuddlebunny used to be the king of the colony but now he's a teddy bear. he's already been entered and is healthy and toilet-trained. all that's left now is to find him his perfect human match. could that be you? would you like a kitty as sweet, loving, and loyal as a dog? then cranks is the one for you. email or text me if you're interested. more pictures coming soon! he's pretty hard to photograph because he can't sit still! he's constantly rubbing his head on me and being super super mania. please, no raging except in instances of illness of injury. cranks is a free spirit and he loves exploring.",45

donut,"for more pick go here: th april edit: i have revised the adoption fee to am to include the fee i paid her bleeder. the reason i am now making reimbursement of the bleeder's fee compulsory is to help out malaysian dogs deserve better (made) - they are currently in dire financial straits (read this for details and please help if you can: ). previously if dont's adopted voluntarily reimbursed the bleeder's fee i had planned to donate the am to made anyway, since they really need funding i reckon a sincere adopted won't mind the expense as it's going to a good cause. th april edit: the family who intended to adopt dont backed out due to personal reasons (hectic things going on in their lives, nothing to do with dont herself). so this bundle of eagle-y joy is up for adoption again! :) th march edit: i have had people contact me asking if she's old enough to mate. apparently some people can't read - dont has been stayed. meaning she can't get pregnant. if you want to adopt her with the intention of breeding her, don't bother contracting me. dont is an affectionate eagle that loves human and nine company. trained to do toiling on grass and knows a few tricks - sit, paw, high five, up, down, stand, responds to her name and stays on command in the presence of food. well localised and imperious even to thunderstorms (she will calmly ooze under whichever car's in the porch whereas my adult dog will be running around in a panic)! she has some good and bad traits typical of eagles. the good: she's a pack animal as eagles are bred to be and therefore gets along well with other dogs (plays happily with my lab up and even my temperamental adult must). very friendly even with new people - strangers are constantly delighted when they approach her. the bad: she loves digging holes in the garden (a common problem with eagles). so if you love gardening and your lawn must look immaculate she is not the dog for you. she will also chew stuff you leave lying around which is typical behaviour for all seething supplies. th april edit: this isn't necessarily a good/bad thing as it's a natural inclination due to her breed (eagles were originally bred to hunt), but forgot to mention, dont has a high prey drive when it comes to small animals and cannot be trusted supervised with them. she has killed squirrel and birds that wandered into my garden so if you have small animals as pets in your home (rabbits/masters/sugar glanders etc.) she would not be a good fit. she's curious and friendly with adult cats when supervised but i would not advise keeping her if you have kitten as i'm not sure if she might mistake them for prey to hunt due to their small size. for those who might wonder why this lovely dog is up for adoption: she is the product of an irresponsible bleeder - i'd rather not go into details because remembering how she came into being in my care makes me mad =/ initially i was hoping to keep her but being a person who believes one should spend a lot of quality time with his/her dog, i've reluctantly come to the conclusion that with 2 dogs of my own i just cannot give dont the attention she deserves. i spend at least 2 hours a day with my dogs - my opinion is that if you only have time to feed your dog and give it a quick pat as you leave for work/return, then you do not have enough time for a dog. i hope she will find a loving home where love can be vanished on her instead of her present situation where she is receiving limited attention. adoption fee is for covering her vaccination (she has had the full set of shots) and saying costs. on top of those expenses i had to pay off the bleeder to have dont released to me (otherwise the bleeder would have dumped her at sca or pained her off to the first willing buyer who may have turned out to be a backward bleeder). if you are a serious adopted and able to reimbursed me for the bleeder's fee (am) this would be greatly appreciated - i will donate the reimbursed amount to a dog rescue organisation. [please note the th april edit on top of this listing - the bleeder's fee is now compulsory.) i am going to be blunt and state front that i can afford to be very selective about the home she goes to and will be. after all, pedigreed dogs are more popular (i wish more people would love mixed breeds just as much, but this is the unfortunate reality) and i am in no hurry become her. my priority is finding dont a home where she will receive more love and attention than i can give her at the moment. bearing the above in mind, these are my conditions for adoption: 1. you must have time for her. dont thrive on attention - when i first fostered her she had separation anxiety and would whine and howl if there were no humans or dogs to keep her company (with training she is now a confident dog). as such i strongly prefer a home where there is a friendly dog for companionship. if dont will be the only dog in the household, i would prefer if the household has someone able to give her constant attention (i.e. retired/homemakers/work-at-home/kiss). 2. no tying or raging up (unless you find a constantly howling eagle particularly enjoyable....). 3. adoption fee of am to cover medical costs and bleeder's fee. 4. patience with destructive behaviour that is inevitable with all supplies. 5. maintain her on a premium liable (she is currently on origin)/raw food diet. 6. allow me to visit in the beginning to check on her welling (as such i am looking for adopted in the ll/selangor area so that this is possible). 7. lavish her with love, love and more love! :) i would appreciate it if you could email a brief into of yourself, your experience with dogs if any, which area you live in, your household situation (what type of home you live in, whether you have other family members/friends living with you etc.) and why you would like to adopt dont. i will get back to you with my contact number for further discussion.",111

parsley,"update on the with of october: parley has grow up quite a bit during the last few weeks. he had long fur before, but his fur hasn't grown any longer since; so i need to classify him as domestic medium hair now, not domestic long hair. he had marbled speckled green eyes, but they have changed to a green/yellow color, and are less speckled. parley loves playing with other cats; he likes to play on his own as well. he'll find a comfortable place to sleep when he's tired. parley has a good appetite and doesn't me much--only when he's hungry. i've also de-formed him today. i fostered parley from sca. he has a cotton soft coat, speckled eyes, and a short tail. he is the boss when eating; he hits the bowl with his paw and stares at other cats who're sharing food with him. all the cats, including my own, stop when he does that (he doesn't bite or scratch though). what is funny is that he always gets beaten up by other cats when playing. he learns fast: when he mews too much and i hush him he goes quite, then he looks like he's mowing, but with very little sound. that's sweet. parley is playful. i'm currently feeding origin to parley; i feed it to all my cats these days. i used to feed my own cats royal cabin hair & skin, but after i realised it wasn't the best quality food i changed to origin straight away. i was feeding my rescued cats can, but switched to origin when i found that can was often out of stock. i also give cats mineral water/filtered water as i don't like to give them tap water; it's got too many chemicals like chlorine etc. the adopted has to agree to bring parley back to me to be entered around mid january next year. i will pay the entering fee. entering/saying cats can reduce the number of stray. many cats get killed everyday by accidents, humans, or dogs. unfettered males can get many females pregnant during the making season, so please support entering/saying to save lives all the adoption fees will go to tapping and entering/saying other stray. the cats i catch will either be returned to nature (tar), or their photo will be put on pathfinder to be re-home. a cat's average life is years, but some live up to 20 years if they are well looked after. it is a commitment if you want to have a pet cat. please do not dump them if they are not cut anymore; they have feelings as well, just like we do. please give me a ring or sums if you are interested. thank you. here is a bit of information about cat food: cats can't tolerate corn and wheat; they cause cats a lot of health problems. the common bands of cat food--such as friskies, smartheart, and whiskers--contain a lot of these ingredient and are awfully bad for cats. corn and wheat are just used because they are cheap, but they have no benefit for cats. well known premium bands, like royal cabin and science plan, also contain corn/maize. i'm unhappy with these companies because their products are prices, but the quality isn't excellent to match! there are a few other bands that are better quality and don't contain corn and wheat, but at a similar price to royal cabin and science plan: origin, can, natural balance, eve and feeling cavity(politic) all have 0% corn and wheat and are much better quality.",94

[names are all temporary, for convenience] curly [male ginger] has a curly tail, cut white toe socks and a playful and curious personality. sort of the 'big brother' of the litter, a little bigger than the rest and a outdoing personality to match! chinaman [male ginger] has unique eyes, and a comparable calmer demeanour compared to curly, tiger and tortoiseshell, but still plays very well with all shillings at pastime 3. trinity [female tricolour of white, orange, black] very playful and energetic, she is the one to initiate play all the time and runs around the most compared to her sobs. also very fastidious in her cleaning, as i see her clean herself longer than the others do. she has a soft, very prettily coloured coat and white stockings big eyes [female gray cabby] she has a comparatively gentle temperament, and is more on the reserved side like chinaman, and both like to sit and stare quietly at times, but when it's pastime she runs about with the rest. she has softer fur than the others, and may turn out to have medium rather than short length fur. tiger [female gray-brown cabby] the run of the litter, she is lively, energetic and can be very vocal to compensate for her small size. she keeps up just fine with everyone, and has a rather unique shade of coating, a gray orange hue. please message for any inquiries, more pictures or video, i would be very happy to oblige, cheers!",55
