rain,we rescued her from a park in us it had been raining heavily nonstop when we discovered her by chance she was very weak starving cold and most probably she barely had strength to move but when we tried to help her she responded with a domesticated attitude we brought her home from the rain because we know she would die if we didn help when we brought her home she responded quite affectionate however she want very active cause she was still very tired and also had a slight limp she looks like she is a american estime although i doubt she is a pure breed when we found her she want smell even when she was fully soaked which lead us to conclude that she hasn been homeless for more than 5 days we have asked around the neighbourhood to try to find the owner however we feel that she was abandoned our situation dont allow us to permanently adopt her since we are students with a very limited income as well as we are already daring for a beautiful dog who we rescued 3 years ago she already seems well manner and obeys when prompted to sit the only negative we noticed is that she guards her food with an attitude we think this is because she may had had to defend for her self when she was out on the street additional she got along fine with our dog after the initial excitement of being introduced watsapp me if your interested thanks

tasha and sasha,dear all these are two female supplies that i have found by the side of a busy road on my way to work i couldn leave them there knowing what would eventually happen to them i brought them home the state of our country is such that most shelters are barely surviving with minimal funds therefore i am trying to find them loving homes on my own i would love to keep them myself but i already have four dogs my neighbours are not very happy and asking me to bang as if they are some unwanted rubbish apparently they are not as compassionate as i would like them to be i have checked with the local authority and i was told that there can only be four dogs per household and i may keep more if the neighbours dont complain but if they do they will remove all the dogs and put them to sleep may not be the case perhaps they were just trying to scare me now run the risk of losing all my dogs but i still believe i can find these supplies loving home with your help please help me give these supplies a chance at lifeall you have to do is to help me find them a home may god bless your act of kindness

mio,read before deciding mio is an active playful and talkative male cat he used to be my friends pet but later given to me because my friend moved oversea he already stayed with me for about 5 months until now he really is a smart and beautiful cat but since in just a university student i cannot afford the fee for his vaccination and never he is now in heat state and need to be entered soon or mate with female cat but i dont dare to mate him with stray cat so that is why i choose to give him for adoption for free as a hope that someone might adopt him to take him to the met or just mate him with female cat that you might have plus i will also give along his cage food bowl and litter box all for free here i tell you some about mio personality so you can take into consideration before adopt him very talkative so you have to be ready to hear some noise from him he is on heat so he will be more more noisy during night sometimes spoiled cat so make sure you give him lot of affection toilet trained he really can see in your toilet bowl if you allow him to super clean he doesn like dirty cat litter stubborn he can become very stubborn when it comes to bed which he might insist to sleep with you on your bed or jump to your lap and he will become noisy if you dont let him to do so afraid of thunder and heavy rain yes if there is a thunder storm or heavy rain he will definitely mowing very loud to get your attention he will be quiet when he is accompanied might become aggressive to new cat i guess this is because he is on heat so if you wished to mate him with your cat it may take longer time for them to adapt do not confine the cat in the cage although i give you the cage because it will make him stress but overall he is very nice cut and unique isn he he also love to muddle contact me by email or whatsapp if you are ready to adopt him and accept the consequences above i really hope that you will become a nice new owner and please be a committed and responsible owner for mio thank you

gabby,cabby is a beautiful sleek black puppy estimated to be at 3 months old when she turned up that was in march cabby is a lovely quiet dog that hardly barks she loves to sit and watch us when we are gardening or sit with us when we are at ease at the porch area our friends who visited us remarked what a gentle soul cabby is the children had no problems playing with her as cabby is not rough we have recently had a by party were received encouraging remarks that cabby does not paw bite or disturb any of the guests when they eat or drink cabby was lured to our neighborhood by an irresponsible family who was unable to care for her we gave our home as garbs shelter in order for cabby to be safe from traffic pedestrian abuse and harsh outdoor weather this beautiful puppy is growing up in our compound and is turning out to be a gentle dog who loves long walks mummy rubs sitting with us during evenings and lots of loving attention we would like to find cabby a forever home with a loving family as we are unable to be home at all times our job takes us on long outstation trips and it makes it difficult for us to care for her in the long term while we are not around our neighbours are understanding enough to watch over her until we get back should anyone be interested in adopting this gentle black female up do contact me i will reply as soon as i am able fads q is cabby trained in anyway a yes garbs been sent for a temperament testing by a professional dog trainer cabby is also trained to know basic obedience commands eg sit stay donets should garbs adoption be successful the adopted will inherit her original file as proof of the training she has gone through including the contact of the dog trainer q will cabby delicate soil our porch area a no we have trained her to understand that she is to do her business only while outside of the home the adopted must commit to walking cabby twice a day once in the morning and once in the evening everyday q how long should these dog walks be a anything from 15mins and above should do the trick as long as cabby gets her walks gets to do her business she will be a happy dog and a happy dog makes a happy master q is cabby stayed deformed and generally checked for good health a yes her medical records are all with our trusted met you will also be given her medical book for proof and as a reference to her visits to the met q why the fees a we have taken pains to ensure that garbs properly vaccinated deformed antifleaticks fed healthy localised used to human interactions and above all trained for basic obedience commands to allow the adopted to have a much more easier time with the new pet our fees includes 1 a sleeping cot 2 her favourite toys 3 medical book 4 file certificate terrified by a pro trainer 5 walking leash collar q i we have never had a pet dog before how will i know if i am doing the right thing a dont worry we will spend time with you and cabby to teach you how to maintain her good habits and training in order for the transition to go smoothly this will usually take about 2 to 3 hours should you have any questions you may contact us for further advise as well we will be happy to help you feel at ease with your newly adopted pet until you are ready to be on your own with cabby temperament testing the suitable adopted as cabby has undergone a professional temperament test by our trusted dog trainer we are delighted to share with you on the sort of suitable owners she will be comfortable with 1 if you are a family your children should be at the age of 12 or above and will not be afraid of dogs all family members should also be responsible take turns for practicing maintaining garbs training to ensure her obedience 2 if you are a single person you should be one of a stable routine with a commitment to taking care of cabby for the rest of her life in return you will have the most loyal and affectionate companion for life 3 cabby has been tested as a gentle dog with a friendly disposition she is not aggressive nor is she territorial she will love any attention you can give her but she is also capable of being on her own most of the times as long as her basic needs daily walks food drinks play training are met 4 cabby is good on her own as the only dog in the household if you have another dog and would like to adopt cabby as a companion it would be advisable if your dog is also given a temperament test to determine if your dog is compatible with cabby cabby is not good with aggressive and dominant dogs also note if you wish to have cabby as a companion to your existing dog all her training could be for naught if your dog is not trained to listen to commands deferential treatment will render all of garbs training useless 5 if you have a cat have no fear cabby is friendly and double towards lines of all kinds in fact cabby is a catmagnet in our neighbourhood to date she has rescued two kitten one adopted one in foster care and is not aggressive towards cats she just wants to play with them mostly 6 cabby has received the first basic obedience training should you wish to pursue the next course she is ready for the second stage intermediate training with more detailed varied disciplinary commands requirements for adoption as we have faced many set backs in regards to the adoption of our rescued pets we would like for any potential adopted to meet these basic criterion before contracting us 1 as an adopted you should have your own landed property not rental neither owned by the company you work for nor renting under another name this is to avoid any future problems such as becoming the pet 2 as an adopted you should have a stable existing job to provide for the adopted pets every need 3 adopted pets should never ever be abandoned again if you feel incapable in providing for them 4 as an adopted you must realise that when you take on a pet they will be an addition to your life in every aspect of every way adopting a pet is akin to adopting another family member love is not enough as all manner of care responsibility commitment to their happiness will be in your hands if you have any doubts please carefully reconsider all these points mentioned above so that we may spare the pet and us of any unnecessary stress we love all of our rescue and treat them like our own kiss but we also discipline them without favour wed like you to think of them as your own kiss too

baby,free adoption
mosu mosu urgent fosteringadopt,help needed most most is a mamma cat her age is unknown she has pointed colour like the soames but she is most probably mixed breed has blue eyes she suddenly appeared where we live so it only means one thing she either lost or like most pretty cats that end up hereabandoned most most is special compared to other cats why is a cat like her out here on the streets she definitely must have been a house cat before she is very affectionate gentle and slightly cowardly dealing with other cats but very friendly she gets attached to humans very quickly she has never scratched or bit us but once when i was unconsciously jingling my house keys she scratched me accidentally while trying to catch the keys wounds so she plays too i guess she trusts us waaaay too much she got herself attached here and when she got pregnant she glued herself here she behaves absolutely like a house cat seems more intelligent than any other cats here maybe due to her mixed breed genet very well behaved and understands when we say no when we let she uses the litter box when we close it she goes outside to do her business in pretty healthy and had no signs of galleries so far despite having so many stray cats around but lately give gotten really sick it seems i am allergic to most most she too furry only the mamma catmosu most makes me seize and have funny nose but most most is attached to us and rates and refuses to socialist with other outside cats so i am hiding the fact that she is making me sick from my family so i need someone to at least help foster her or something because i dont want to send her to places like paws or sca anyone who likes a muddle cat who is gentle and affectionate that does not cause trouble will love most most

simba, update 14 limb was entered today and will be ready to go to his new family in a week or so update 14 limb has had a bath and is looking quite handsome now and he has finally brought his tail out from between his legs and is even wagging his tail when we picked limb up he was really so scared and frightened that his tail was stuck between his legspoor thing i dont normally say mean things but i hope that his owners rot in hell for abandoning him for letting him suffer physical and mental stress of living on the streets and finding for himself for being knocked down by a car and injuring his leg and for being caught by the dog catches 14 this is limb he was abandoned by his owners when they shifted out of their house they just threw him out on the streets the poor boy waited for them to come back for him and refused to move from that road eventhough it was a very busy road the neighbours in the area started feeding him and they tried to catch him several times but he would always evade them sometime last week he was hit by a car and his front leg was injured again the people that were feeding him tried to catch him but to no avail and then one idiotic and heartless neighbour decided to report him to the council saying that he was a dangerous dog although he kept to himself and was just waiting for his family and poor limb got caught the people feeding him called me and asked me to help get him out thankful i managed to claim him back from the council but limb was petrified when we went to get him out he couldn move he was frozen with fear there were lots of other dogs there that had been caught and i know that this is the case with all the council pounds i wish i could have taken them all but i couldn it took us quite a while to finally get him out but we finally succeeded we brought him back to my place and it took over an hour before he finally realised that he was safe he had a good sleep probably the first time he slept peacefully since he was abandoned he will be going to met today and i would be grateful if one of you could help foster him while he recovers from his injury and while i look for a new forever home for him he will not do well being boarded as he is quite a timid dog we could look after him ourselves but we already have way too many animals please call me if you can help foster this lovely boy i will take care of all medical expenses and food bills etc i just need a home environment where he can rest and regain his faith in humans or better still if you can give him a forever home that he deserves that will be even better please sums or whatsapp me at if you can either foster or adopt limb if you can please help share this so that limb will have a better chance of getting a home terms and conditions for adoption 1 must not be caged or chained unnecessarily 2 must be given clean shelter from the heat and rain 3 must be fed proper food and be given access to water at all times 4 must be given medical care and attention when necessary 5 will only be released to the adopted after entering is if you ever lose your dog please call all the nearby councils and insist that you want to go and check their pounds cause sometimes they will just say that they didn catch any dogs in a particular area your dog could be waiting for you helplessly and you should check immediately on the day you lost the dog and the subsequent days after that cause sometimes they may not be taken to the pound immediately

callie,indoor cats i would prefer my cats are kept as indoor cats with space to run around and play i am very strict about not raging my fur kiss and hope you dont cage them unless required by met cats are curious animals and are constantly exploring their surroundings give them space to walk and run around but also remember to kitty proof your house good quality food my cats are fed some sort of premium bands good quality food is important to maintain their health and more beneficial for you in the long run less met visits companions cats are very social animals and it is wealthier to adopt two so they can have another cat to play or interact with especially if you are busy at work or otherwise most of the day but if you can only get one cat then please consider adopting an adult cat adult cats are usually litter box trained stayed and easier to take care their personality is developed and you know what you get they are also more independent and mellow in their games and spend a lot of time tapping medicalvets my cats are not spayedneutered if less than 6 months you must agree to do so at 6 months you must also agree to give bolster shots if required and yearly veterinary examination other conditions i love to receive updated on their progress with pictures taking care of fur kiss is easy all they need is some food lots of love attention and they will be at your side all their life but before adopting please consider your financial situation good quality food met visits etc will need to be budget

rex,red was an abandoned and we believe abused dog that was rescued by a client from an area close to her workplace the rescue had seemed our services in bringing red personally to the clinic for treatment and to be boarded he has been boarded in the clinic since march and is looking for a loving home efforts are being made to make this happen for red red needs someone who will patiently want to know him for who he is red loves to play fetch and he loves to gnaws on his chew bone he loves them dental treats too a perfect guard dog because this boy is alert at all times forget tip toying away because he notices everything once he build his trust in you you could certainly find a loyal friend in him his favourite past time is to sit and watch the world go by with you honesty is the best policy and these are my thoughts boarding is part of the services provided but it isn the main function if in lucky during my working hours i could spend up to an hour plus with him but those days are harder to come by otherwise its after my working hours when in off working half day his walks are only limited to the clinics back lane and his view of the world is increasing as months pass by in my opinion picture this put ourselves in his shoes who likes the same old mundane view and then its back to being caged the rest of the time and the cycle repeats i get it that the rescue is financing his stay but one must be realistic i just dont think its healthy for red or any animal per say to be boarded for a long time and in yes case is he still going to be boarded until the end of the year next year look into his eyestell me you dont see what i see there is a story thermal he needs is someone who is willing to decide it his eyes do look sad to me too its like as though he is crying out and wondering is this what his life is going to be like reaching an animal is one thing but you also have to think about the animals welling too since he has been here since march its not about the money its about his happiness other animals they come and go and red he is just here its heartbreaking to see his life at a standstill like this just awaiting for someone to adopt him and the wait has extended for months and months i do feel it a lot since i am the one who has the most contact with him if i hadn vigorously started getting the word out about red no one would have really heard about him the rescue has never once visited him nor was there any posters or ulcers made on her part to be distributed the last time she had asked about red was ages ago if human beings could get depression animals could too please introduce yourself by calling smiling dropping by the clinic if you want to give red a chance to be himself again sincerely basin wrists ark senior assistant

jasper,this is jasperi have had him for almost 3 years now the reason i am giving him up for adoption is because the place i live in is very unsuitable for him there are too many stray cats in my area and paper has come home too many times after being involved in serious cat fights i have had to take him to the met hospital so many times as an emergency case because of his fighting i tried to keep him indoors and not letting him go out but he got very depressed and want interested in anything anymore he loves to go out and sit in the sun and to roll in the grass however where i live the place is very dangerous and there are hardly any fields for him to run and play at i am looking for someone who seriously loves and understands cats it is very important that the area you live in should have a fieldwork as close to the house as possible or hopefully your housing area is safe and clean he needs to go out into the field and play otherwise he gets very cranks if you only lock him indoors paper is a very loving cat very chubby and fat he almost 6 g he loves people and loves to be petted also he a vegetarian he only eats cat biscuits nothing else not chicken fish drawn etc he also trained to use the cat litter but he has a weak immune system and he prone to getting a fly often so if you are interested in paper you also need to know that he needs a bolster every week its a small bottle about rm49 and it can last a few months you only need to put all of it in his mouth once a week so that paper doesn get the fly i am only looking for serious adopted who will take very good care of paper and will love him very very much he a very special and a beautiful cat if you are interested please email me at or you can send me a ff message at

sim,it was late at night when i was about to leave from work when i heard loud meetings near my car i did not have the heart to leave it there as i saw no signs of its mother nearby so i took it home and fed it with some food and gave it a quick wash i went to the met next day and bought a bottle and milk for cats and it has been drinking from the bottle not only is he playful and adorable he is also quite clever as he has been seeing at the same place in a shoe box laid with newspapers he is always cleaned afterwards a very friendly and active little guy puris almost all the time now especially after being fed even knows where he can get his milk from unfortunately my wife and i are not able to look after him as we are both working until late night we would like to find a home for this little guy with or without a foster mother cat as he can already be fed using a bottle and can already eat soft food as much as we are already attached to this little fell we know that being in a house with daring people to look after him he be much better off without a couple of busy people like us and we would be happy to see him grow with love and become a handsome cat dating again after we gave him away to his new family my husband and i cried our eyes out from missing him last night i still feel all choked up when i look at his pictures and video the night my husband brought him in we didn have anything suitable to feed a kitten with but an ivan going as desperate as he was we had to give him something to eat so ivan going it was and a few drops of dutch lady full cream milk the next day we had only planned to drop him at a local met in hoping that a good samaritan would take him in but the clerk said they dont take animals in so we ended up buying the little fell a bottle and 2 boxes of milk for cats since then we had been feeding him the milk we left him at home and when we came back later that night we saw him sitting quietly at one spot and we also saw spots of white vomit and yellowish liquid stool after immediately cleaning him up him looked sleepy i thought he might be tired from vomiting like humans would so i wrapped him up and huddled him after a while i thought something was strange about him usually he would wake up if there was even a slight movement this time he didn even stir i also noticed that he suited liquid from his rectum while he was sleeping it was night no gets would still be open so i read up a webster at which describes a condition of a kitten from its stool and urine color and texture i suspected that he might be suffering from food poisoning the ivan going and the dutch lady milk i was devastated thinking that him might not last that night as his body was so weak his head just lolled if supported his paws were almost cold all the signs i though that he was really dying i couldn bear the thought of seeing him die all by myself as my husband was at work at that time all i could do that night was rub him to keep him warm and pray that he be ok i was already so smitten by this kitten although we couldn keep it i really wanted it to live miraculous my prayers were answered when him suddenly got up eyes wide open and started roaming the room i was like were you playing tricks on me it was really miraculous i couldn explain it if its actually normal but i was extremely grateful i still am today after the gruesome experience we went the extra mile to look after him like looking after a human baby brought him a proper food for kitten took him to the met when he didn see and too one whole day as it turns out he was still too young to see on his own so whenever he wanted to see he would let out signs which i finally figured out that if when he is mowing but wanted neither food nor milk i would put him in the shoebox stimulate him and if he didn resist he would proceed to see until he is done at first i have mixed feelings about touching an animal at its genitals but after the first time and seeing how at ease he felt it really made me feel like a moment in those six days we took care of him we were quite surprised that a lot of people were asking for him from this avert for that thank you all for your interest it really meant a lot to us the morning before we gave him up i decided to give him a little wash as i know that all cats hate cold water i bathed him in warm water and he loved it didn squire didn kick around didn scratch me for putting him in such a spot at one point i thought he wanted to immense himself in the water hata and then i wrapped him up and he fell asleep again before i fed him one last time throughout the one hour journey to his new owner him just slept away we really think that he is so much like a human baby who would fall asleep in car rides because of the aircond and the feeling of the car moving him him after handing him over the new owner has been keeping in touch with us to ask what should she do if him is giving certain signs i felt a bit worried if aims signs were mislead and all those sort of stuff a mon would typically be worried of text messages from the new owner saying that he likes to climb on top of people and follow them around the house all the things him did to us showed us that he is settled at his new home and his new family i tell myself that hell be alright its weird that i have kitten at my parents place but none made me feel like him did none made me feel so emotional attached like him made me feel though he might not even know us what more remember us we pray that hell grow happily and healthy thank you him for the wonderful experience you have given us

mama kin urgent,profile rings name mamma kin age adult catprobably 1 year and half condition healthy and pregnant probably will deliver in early may believed that this is not the first time she is pregnant characteristics adorable soft very affectionate dan sang mania likes to pure a lot likes to roll her self on the floor sang come bill did golekgolekkan baden did matas anti likes to clean herself frequently even with a bulging stomach she is still a playful mamma and like to play why she needs to be adopted sap cause the cat catcher of my hostel block has started their cat cat catching operation and they may take mamma kin away to unknownunsafe placeworse according to the cat catcherthe cats that they have captured will be taken to the too near mamma king story mamma kin is a stray cat that came to my hostel block about two months ago out of nowhere right after meg and her kiss have left us when we started to approach mamma kin we noticed that she is an adult cat and she is also pregnant without any bias or judgment yet with with warm hearts we welcome her to our lives and to this hostel block ami namakan did mamma kin seat kari did add white spots that make her looks as if did papa skin she is a pretty adorable and cut pregnant mummy cat she has been a very good and affectionate cat too did sang mania she likes to pure a lot every time i play with her caress her head stroke her fur and give her some food despite the fact that we love having her around we know that some people dont like it dan some people sang dimaksudkan di sing sarah the hostel management people just like other cases of cats in this hostel block we do fear that mamma kin will be taken away by the cat catcher assigned by the hostel management sooner or later kalaw kucingkucing in diambil dan diana ke tempt seperti sca ke say take wish but the cat catcher once told me that the cats that he has captured will be brought to too near or somewhere unknown i totally dont want these cats to be taken to too near or anywhere else that not safe therefore me and my friends realize that one day we need to find mamma kin a new owner and release her from this cat later place so we at first plan to give her away for adoption after she has given birth unfortunately the day that we fear has come this morning the cat catcher came to my hostel and he and the team searched high and low for any cats just any cats whether its the one that has been entered or not however thank god alhamdulillah and in so grateful that some of my friends who are also cat lovers managed to act quickly and managed to save and hide other cats in some rooms and mamma kin is now hiding in my room and this is not the end they will come again soon cause they know the cats that they are searching for are not captured today with all this panic moment and in such dangerous state i think i can wait until mamma kin has delivered i can wait after her delivery its going to take longer time and her life is at stake now if i may put it that way so in putting up mamma king profile in here so that anybody who a true cat lover kindhearted considerate and daring out there could have the heart to adopt her please yes she is pregnant and the person who would love to adopt her must be the one who is prepared and ready for new comes if that person doesn plan to have them all perhaps you could be patient for awhile and later you could give them away for adoption once the kitten are big enough in searching for someone who really really appreciated cats whether they are adults or kitten why i say this is because when i advertise meg and her kitten not long ago found out some people like to have the kitten yet abandon the mother there was this one couple who intended to adopt meg and one of her kitten tap this couple told me that they live in an apartment so what they plan to do is to keep the kitten but put meg downstairs with other stray cats kalaw madam tu papa guns say iklankan until meg adopt back say bang said meg ke too near seperti sang dilakukan ole cat catcher di hostel block say ni so basically all in asking and hoping for is to have a cat lover who is responsible and daring to take good care of the pregnant and adorable mamma kin which deserves to feel loved and be happy in a safer place as soon as possible that all please thank you
